Coding Conventions In order to have a uniformized library system, we established the following conventions (that hopefully will be followed by others when making modifications to them :-) ). Documentation All the functions that we want to be \"public\" are documented. We used the faust2md \"standards\" for each library: //### for main title (library name - equivalent to # in markdown), //=== for section declarations (equivalent to ## in markdown) and //--- for function declarations (equivalent to #### in markdown - see basics.lib for an example). Sections in function documentation should be declared as #### markdown title. Each function documentation provides a \"Usage\" section (see basics.lib ). Library Import To prevent cross-references between libraries we generalized the use of the library(\"\") system for function calls in all the libraries. This means that everytime a function declared in another library is called, the environment corresponding to this library needs to be called too. To make things easier, a stdfaust.lib library was created and is imported by all the libraries: an = library(\"analyzers.lib\"); ba = library(\"basics.lib\"); co = library(\"compressors.lib\"); de = library(\"delays.lib\"); dm = library(\"demos.lib\"); dx = library(\"dx7.lib\"); en = library(\"envelopes.lib\"); fi = library(\"filters.lib\"); ho = library(\"hoa.lib\"); it = library(\"interpolators.lib\"); ma = library(\"maths.lib\"); mi = library(\"mi.lib\"); ef = library(\"misceffects.lib\"); os = library(\"oscillators.lib\"); no = library(\"noises.lib\"); pf = library(\"phaflangers.lib\"); pm = library(\"physmodels.lib\"); rm = library(\"reducemaps.lib\"); re = library(\"reverbs.lib\"); ro = library(\"routes.lib\"); sp = library(\"spats.lib\"); si = library(\"signals.lib\"); so = library(\"soundfiles.lib\"); sy = library(\"synths.lib\"); ve = library(\"vaeffects.lib\"); wa = library(\"webaudio.lib\"); vl = library(\"version.lib\"); wd = library(\"wavedigitalfilters.lib\"); For example, if we wanted to use the smooth function which is now declared in signals.lib , we would do the following: import(\"stdfaust.lib\"); process = si.smooth(0.999); This standard is only used within the libraries: nothing prevents coders to still import signals.lib directly and call smooth without ro. , etc. It means symbols and function names defined within a library have to be unique to not collide with symbols of any other libraries. \"Demo\" Functions \"Demo\" functions are placed in demos.lib and have a built-in user interface (UI). Their name ends with the _demo suffix. Each of these function have a .dsp file associated to them in the /examples folder. Any function containing UI elements should be placed in this library and respect these standards. \"Standard\" Functions \"Standard\" functions are here to simplify the life of new (or not so new) Faust coders.

It outputs an index between 0 and 1 at a desired analysis frame. The ZCR of a signal correlates with the noisiness [Gouyon et al. 2000] and the spectral centroid [Herrera-Boyer et al. 2006] of a signal. For sinusoidal signals, the ZCR can be multiplied by ma.SR/2 and used as a frequency detector. For example, it can be deployed as a computationally efficient adaptive mechanism for automatic Larsen suppression. Usage _ : zcr(tau) : _; Where: tau : (time to decay by e^-1) sets the averaging frame in seconds. Spectrum-Analyzers Spectrum-analyzers split the input signal into a bank of parallel signals, one for each spectral band. They are related to the Mth-Octave Filter-Banks in filters.lib . The documentation of this library contains more details about the implementation. The parameters are: M : number of band-slices per octave (>1) N : total number of bands (>2) ftop = upper bandlimit of the Mth-octave bands (<SR/2) In addition to the Mth-octave output signals, there is a highpass signal containing frequencies from ftop to SR/2, and a \"dc band\" lowpass signal containing frequencies from 0 (dc) up to the start of the Mth-octave bands. Thus, the N output signals are: highpass(ftop), MthOctaveBands(M,N-2,ftop), dcBand(ftop*2^(-M*(N-1))) A Spectrum-Analyzer is defined here as any band-split whose bands span the relevant spectrum, but whose band-signals do not necessarily sum to the original signal, either exactly or to within an allpass filtering. Spectrum analyzer outputs are normally at least nearly \"power complementary\", i.e., the power spectra of the individual bands sum to the original power spectrum (to within some negligible tolerance). Increasing Channel Isolation Go to higher filter orders - see Regalia et al. or Vaidyanathan (cited below) regarding the construction of more aggressive recursive filter-banks using elliptic or Chebyshev prototype filters.

Usage _ : toggle : _ Examples button(\"toggle\") : toggle : vbargraph(\"output\", 0, 1) (an.amp_follower(0.1) > 0.01) : toggle : vbargraph(\"output\", 0, 1) // takes audio input (ba.)on_and_off The first channel set the output to 1, the second channel to 0. Usage _ , _ : on_and_off : _ Example button(\"on\"), button(\"off\") : on_and_off : vbargraph(\"output\", 0, 1) (ba.)selectoutn Route input to the output among N at run time. Usage _ : selectoutn(N, i) : _,_,...N Where: N : number of outputs (int, known at compile time, N > 0) i : output number to route to (int, numbered from 0) (i.e. slider) Example process = 1 : selectoutn(3, sel) : par(i, 3, vbargraph(\"v.bargraph %i\", 0, 1)); sel = hslider(\"volume\", 0, 0, 2, 1) : int; Sliding Reduce Provides various operations on the last N samples using a high order `slidingReduce(op,N,maxN,disabledVal,x)`` fold-like function: slidingSum(n) : the sliding sum of the last n input samples, CPU-light slidingSump(n,maxn) : the sliding sum of the last n input samples, numerically stable \"forever\" slidingMax(n,maxn) : the sliding max of the last n input samples slidingMin(n,maxn) : the sliding min of the last n input samples slidingMean(n) : the sliding mean of the last n input samples, CPU-light slidingMeanp(n,maxn) : the sliding mean of the last n input samples, numerically stable \"forever\" slidingRMS(n) : the sliding RMS of the last n input samples, CPU-light slidingRMSp(n,maxn) : the sliding RMS of the last n input samples, numerically stable \"forever\" Working Principle If we want the maximum of the last 8 values, we can do that as: simpleMax(x) = ( ( max(x@0,x@1), max(x@2,x@3) ) :max ), ( ( max(x@4,x@5), max(x@6,x@7) ) :max ) :max; max(x@2,x@3) is the same as max(x@0,x@1)@2 but the latter re-uses a value we already computed,so is more efficient. Using the same trick for values 4 trough 7, we can write: efficientMax(x)= ( ( max(x@0,x@1), max(x@0,x@1)@2 ) :max ), ( ( max(x@0,x@1), max(x@0,x@1)@2 ) :max@4 ) :max; We can rewrite it recursively, so it becomes possible to get the maximum at have any number of values, as long as it's a power of 2. recursiveMax = case { (1,x) => x; (N,x) => max(recursiveMax(N/2,x), recursiveMax(N/2,x)@(N/2)); }; What if we want to look at a number of values that's not a power of 2? For each value, we will have to decide whether to use it or not. If N is bigger than the index of the value, we use it, otherwise we replace it with ( 0-(ma.INFINITY) ): variableMax(N,x) = max( max( ( (x@0 : useVal(0)), (x@1 : useVal(1)) ):max, ( (x@2 : useVal(2)), (x@3 : useVal(3)) ):max ), max( ( (x@4 : useVal(4)), (x@5 : useVal(5)) ):max, ( (x@6 : useVal(6)), (x@7 : useVal(7)) ):max ) ) with { useVal(i) = select2((N>=i) , (0-(ma.INFINITY)),_); }; Now it becomes impossible to re-use any values. To fix that let's first look at how we'd implement it using recursiveMax, but with a fixed N that is not a power of 2. For example, this is how you'd do it with N=3 : binaryMaxThree(x) = ( recursiveMax(1,x)@0, // the first x recursiveMax(2,x)@1 // the second and third x ):max; N=6 binaryMaxSix(x) = ( recursiveMax(2,x)@0, // first two recursiveMax(4,x)@2 // third trough sixth ):max; Note that recursiveMax(2,x) is used at a different delay then in binaryMaxThree , since it represents 1 and 2, not 2 and 3. Each block is delayed the combined size of the previous blocks. N=7 binaryMaxSeven(x) = ( ( recursiveMax(1,x)@0, // first x recursiveMax(2,x)@1 // second and third ):max, ( recursiveMax(4,x)@3 // fourth trough seventh ) ):max; To make a variable version, we need to know which powers of two are used, and at which delay time. Then it becomes a matter of: lining up all the different block sizes in parallel: the first par() statement delaying each the appropriate amount: sumOfPrevBlockSizes() turning it on or off: useVal() getting the maximum of all of them: combine() In Faust, we can only do that for a fixed maximum number of values: maxN variableBinaryMaxN(N,maxN,x) = par(i,maxNrBits,recursiveMax(pow2(i),x)@sumOfPrevBlockSizes(N,maxN,i) : useVal(i)) : combine(maxNrBits) with { // The sum of all the sizes of the previous blocks sumOfPrevBlockSizes(N,maxN,0) = 0; sumOfPrevBlockSizes(N,maxN,i) = (subseq((allBlockSizes(N,maxN)),0,i):>_); allBlockSizes(N,maxN) = par(i, maxNrBits, pow2(i) * isUsed(i) ); maxNrBits = int2nrOfBits(maxN); // get the maximum of all blocks combine(2) = max; combine(N) = max(combine(N-1),_); // Decide wether or not to use a certain value, based on N useVal(i) = select2(isUsed(i), (0-(ma.INFINITY)),_); isUsed(i) = take(i+1, (int2bin(N,maxN))); }; (ba.)slidingReduce Fold-like high order function. Apply a commutative binary operation <op> to the last <n> consecutive samples of a signal <x> . For example : slidingReduce(max,128,128,-(ma.INFINITY)) will compute the maximum of the last 128 samples. The output is updated each sample, unlike reduce, where the output is constant for the duration of a block. Usage _ : slidingReduce(op,N,maxN,disabledVal) : _ Where: N : the number of values to process maxN : the maximum number of values to process, needs to be a power of 2 op : the operator. Needs to be a commutative one. disabledVal : the value to use when we want to ignore a value. In other words, op(x,disabledVal) should equal to x . For example, +(x,0) equals x and min(x,ma.INFINITY) equals x . So if we want to calculate the sum, we need to give 0 as disabledVal , and if we want the minimum, we need to give ma.INFINITY as disabledVal . (ba.)slidingSum The sliding sum of the last n input samples. It will eventually run into numerical trouble when there is a persistent dc component.

It uses a lot more CPU then (ba.)slidingSum(n,maxn), but is numerically stable \"forever\" in return.

Usage _ : slidingMean(N,maxN) : _ Where: N : the number of values to process (ba.)slidingMeanp The sliding mean of the last n input samples. It uses a lot more CPU then (ba.)slidingMean(n,maxn), but is numerically stable \"forever\" in return. Usage _ : slidingMeanp(N,maxN) : _ Where: N : the number of values to process maxN : the maximum number of values to process, needs to be a power of 2 (ba.)slidingRMS The root mean square of the last n input samples. It will eventually run into numerical trouble when there is a persistent dc component. If that matters in your application, use the more CPU-intensive (ba.)slidinRMSp. Usage _ : slidingRMS(N) : _ Where: N : the number of values to process (ba.)slidingRMSp The root mean square of the last n input samples.

Using the same trick for values 4 trough 7, we can write: efficientMax(x)= ( ( max(x@0,x@1), max(x@0,x@1)@2 ) :max ), ( ( max(x@0,x@1), max(x@0,x@1)@2 ) :max@4 ) :max; We can rewrite it recursively, so it becomes possible to get the maximum at have any number of values, as long as it's a power of 2. recursiveMax = case { (1,x) => x; (N,x) => max(recursiveMax(N/2,x), recursiveMax(N/2,x)@(N/2)); }; What if we want to look at a number of values that's not a power of 2? For each value, we will have to decide whether to use it or not. If N is bigger than the index of the value, we use it, otherwise we replace it with ( 0-(ma.INFINITY) ): variableMax(N,x) = max( max( ( (x@0 : useVal(0)), (x@1 : useVal(1)) ):max, ( (x@2 : useVal(2)), (x@3 : useVal(3)) ):max ), max( ( (x@4 : useVal(4)), (x@5 : useVal(5)) ):max, ( (x@6 : useVal(6)), (x@7 : useVal(7)) ):max ) ) with { useVal(i) = select2((N>=i) , (0-(ma.INFINITY)),_); }; Now it becomes impossible to re-use any values. To fix that let's first look at how we'd implement it using recursiveMax, but with a fixed N that is not a power of 2. For example, this is how you'd do it with N=3 : binaryMaxThree(x) = ( recursiveMax(1,x)@0, // the first x recursiveMax(2,x)@1 // the second and third x ):max; N=6 binaryMaxSix(x) = ( recursiveMax(2,x)@0, // first two recursiveMax(4,x)@2 // third trough sixth ):max; Note that recursiveMax(2,x) is used at a different delay then in binaryMaxThree , since it represents 1 and 2, not 2 and 3. Each block is delayed the combined size of the previous blocks. N=7 binaryMaxSeven(x) = ( ( recursiveMax(1,x)@0, // first x recursiveMax(2,x)@1 // second and third ):max, ( recursiveMax(4,x)@3 // fourth trough seventh ) ):max; To make a variable version, we need to know which powers of two are used, and at which delay time. Then it becomes a matter of: lining up all the different block sizes in parallel: the first par() statement delaying each the appropriate amount: sumOfPrevBlockSizes() turning it on or off: useVal() getting the maximum of all of them: combine() In Faust, we can only do that for a fixed maximum number of values: maxN variableBinaryMaxN(N,maxN,x) = par(i,maxNrBits,recursiveMax(pow2(i),x)@sumOfPrevBlockSizes(N,maxN,i) : useVal(i)) : combine(maxNrBits) with { // The sum of all the sizes of the previous blocks sumOfPrevBlockSizes(N,maxN,0) = 0; sumOfPrevBlockSizes(N,maxN,i) = (subseq((allBlockSizes(N,maxN)),0,i):>_); allBlockSizes(N,maxN) = par(i, maxNrBits, pow2(i) * isUsed(i) ); maxNrBits = int2nrOfBits(maxN); // get the maximum of all blocks combine(2) = max; combine(N) = max(combine(N-1),_); // Decide wether or not to use a certain value, based on N useVal(i) = select2(isUsed(i), (0-(ma.INFINITY)),_); isUsed(i) = take(i+1, (int2bin(N,maxN))); };","title":"Working Principle"},{"location":"libs/basics/#baslidingreduce","text":"Fold-like high order function.

It can be implemented as a compressor having a high threshold (near the clipping level), fast attack, and high ratio. Since the compression ratio is so high, some knee smoothing is desirable (for softer limiting). This example is intended to get you started using compressors as limiters, so all parameters are hardwired here to nominal values. Ratio: 4 (moderate compression) See compressor_mono() comments for a guide to other choices. Mike Shipley likes this (lowest) setting on the 1176. (Grammy award-winning mixer for Queen, Tom Petty, etc.) Thresh: -6 dB, meaning 4:1 compression begins at amplitude 1/2. Att: 800 MICROseconds (Note: scaled by ratio in the 1176) The 1176 range is said to be 20-800 microseconds. Faster attack gives \"more bite\" (e.g. on vocals), and makes hard-clipping less likely on fast overloads. Rel: 0.5 s (Note: scaled by ratio in the 1176) The 1176 range is said to be 50-1100 ms. The 1176 also has a \"bright, clear eq effect\" (use filters.lib if desired). limiter_1176_R4_mono is a standard Faust function.

It can be implemented as a compressor having a high threshold (near the clipping level), fast attack and release, and high ratio. Since the ratio is so high, some knee smoothing is desirable (\"soft limiting\"). This example is intended to get you started using compressor_* as a limiter, so all parameters are hardwired to nominal values here. Ratios: 4 (moderate compression), 8 (severe compression), 12 (mild limiting), or 20 to 1 (hard limiting) Att: 20-800 MICROseconds (Note: scaled by ratio in the 1176) Rel: 50-1100 ms (Note: scaled by ratio in the 1176) Mike Shipley likes 4:1 (Grammy-winning mixer for Queen, Tom Petty, etc.) Faster attack gives \"more bite\" (e.g. on vocals) He hears a bright, clear eq effect as well (not implemented here) Usage _,_ : limiter_1176_R4_stereo : _,_; Reference: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1176_Peak_Limiter (co.)limiter_lad_N N-channel lookahead limiter inspired by IOhannes Zm\u00f6lnig's post, which is in turn based on the thesis by Peter Falkner \"Entwicklung eines digitalen Stereo-Limiters mit Hilfe des Signalprozessors DSP56001\". This version of the limiter uses a peak-holder with smoothed attack and release based on tau time constant filters. It is also possible to use a time constant that is 2 PI tau by dividing the attack and release times by 2*PI. This time constant allows for the amplitude profile to reach 1 - e^(-2pi) of the final peak after the attack time. The input path can be delayed by the same amount as the attack time to synchronise input and amplitude profile, realising a system that is particularly effective as a colourless (ideally) brickwall limiter. Note that the effectiveness of the ceiling settings are dependent on the other parameters, especially the time constant used for the smoothing filters and the lookahead delay. Similarly, the colourless characteristics are also dependent on attack, hold, and release times. Since fluctuations above ~15 Hz are perceived as timbral effects, [Vassilakis and Kendall 2010] it is reasonable to set the attack time to 1/15 seconds for a smooth amplitude modulation. On the other hand, the hold time can be set to the peak-to-peak period of the expected lowest frequency in the signal, which allows for minimal distortion of the low frequencies. The release time can then provide a perceptually linear and gradual gain increase determined by the user for any specific application. The scaling factor for all the channels is determined by the loudest peak between them all, so that amplitude ratios between the signals are kept. Usage si.bus(N) : limiter_lad_N(N, LD, ceiling, attack, hold, release) : si.bus(N); Where: N is the number of channels, known at compile-time. LD is the lookahead delay in seconds, known at compile-time. ceiling is the linear amplitude output limit. attack is the attack time in seconds. hold is the hold time in seconds. release is the release time in seconds.

Reference: http://iem.at/~zmoelnig/publications/limiter/. (co.)limiter_lad_bw Specialised case of limiter_lad_N and ready-to-use unit-amplitude mono limiting function. This implementation, in particular, uses 2pi*tau time constant filters for attack and release smoothing with synchronised input and gain signals. This function's best application is to be used as a brickwall limiter with the least colouring artefacts while keeping a not-so-slow release curve. Tests have shown that, given a pop song with 60 dB of amplification and a 0-dB-ceiling, the loudest peak recorded was ~0.38 dB.

This version of the limiter uses a peak-holder with smoothed attack and release based on tau time constant filters. It is also possible to use a time constant that is 2 PI tau by dividing the attack and release times by 2*PI. This time constant allows for the amplitude profile to reach 1 - e^(-2pi) of the final peak after the attack time. The input path can be delayed by the same amount as the attack time to synchronise input and amplitude profile, realising a system that is particularly effective as a colourless (ideally) brickwall limiter. Note that the effectiveness of the ceiling settings are dependent on the other parameters, especially the time constant used for the smoothing filters and the lookahead delay. Similarly, the colourless characteristics are also dependent on attack, hold, and release times. Since fluctuations above ~15 Hz are perceived as timbral effects, [Vassilakis and Kendall 2010] it is reasonable to set the attack time to 1/15 seconds for a smooth amplitude modulation. On the other hand, the hold time can be set to the peak-to-peak period of the expected lowest frequency in the signal, which allows for minimal distortion of the low frequencies. The release time can then provide a perceptually linear and gradual gain increase determined by the user for any specific application. The scaling factor for all the channels is determined by the loudest peak between them all, so that amplitude ratios between the signals are kept.","title":"(co.)limiter_lad_N"},{"location":"libs/compressors/#usage_15","text":"si.bus(N) : limiter_lad_N(N, LD, ceiling, attack, hold, release) : si.bus(N); Where: N is the number of channels, known at compile-time.

Example See dm.pospass_demo Look at frequency response: Method A filter passing only positive frequencies can be made from a half-band lowpass by modulating it up to the positive-frequency range. Equivalently, down-modulate the input signal using a complex sinusoid at -SR/4 Hz, lowpass it with a half-band filter, and modulate back up by SR/4 Hz.

They are related to the Mth-Octave Spectrum-Analyzers in analysis.lib . The documentation of this library contains more details about the implementation. The parameters are: M : number of band-slices per octave (>1) N : total number of bands (>2) ftop : upper bandlimit of the Mth-octave bands (<SR/2) In addition to the Mth-octave output signals, there is a highpass signal containing frequencies from ftop to SR/2, and a \"dc band\" lowpass signal containing frequencies from 0 (dc) up to the start of the Mth-octave bands. Thus, the N output signals are highpass(ftop), MthOctaveBands(M,N-2,ftop), dcBand(ftop*2^(-M*(N-1))) A Filter-Bank is defined here as a signal bandsplitter having the property that summing its output signals gives an allpass-filtered version of the filter-bank input signal. A more conventional term for this is an \"allpass-complementary filter bank\". If the allpass filter is a pure delay (and possible scaling), the filter bank is said to be a \"perfect-reconstruction filter bank\" (see Vaidyanathan-1993 cited below for details). A \"graphic equalizer\", in which band signals are scaled by gains and summed, should be based on a filter bank. The filter-banks below are implemented as Butterworth or Elliptic spectrum-analyzers followed by delay equalizers that make them allpass-complementary. Increasing Channel Isolation Go to higher filter orders - see Regalia et al. or Vaidyanathan (cited below) regarding the construction of more aggressive recursive filter-banks using elliptic or Chebyshev prototype filters.

They are related to the Mth-Octave Spectrum-Analyzers in analysis.lib . The documentation of this library contains more details about the implementation. The parameters are: M : number of band-slices per octave (>1) N : total number of bands (>2) ftop : upper bandlimit of the Mth-octave bands (<SR/2) In addition to the Mth-octave output signals, there is a highpass signal containing frequencies from ftop to SR/2, and a \"dc band\" lowpass signal containing frequencies from 0 (dc) up to the start of the Mth-octave bands. Thus, the N output signals are highpass(ftop), MthOctaveBands(M,N-2,ftop), dcBand(ftop*2^(-M*(N-1))) A Filter-Bank is defined here as a signal bandsplitter having the property that summing its output signals gives an allpass-filtered version of the filter-bank input signal. A more conventional term for this is an \"allpass-complementary filter bank\". If the allpass filter is a pure delay (and possible scaling), the filter bank is said to be a \"perfect-reconstruction filter bank\" (see Vaidyanathan-1993 cited below for details). A \"graphic equalizer\", in which band signals are scaled by gains and summed, should be based on a filter bank.

Utility Functions These utility functions are used to help certain operations (e.g. define initial positions and velocities for physical elements). (mi.)initState Used to set initial delayed position values that must be initialised at step 0 of the physics simulation. If you develop any of your own modules, you will need to use this (see mass and springDamper algorithm codes for examples). Usage x: initState(x0) : _ Where: x : position value signal x0 : initial value for position Mass Algorithms All mass-type physical element functions are declared here. They all expect to receive a force input signal and produce a position signal. All physical parameters are expressed in sample-rate dependant values. (mi.)mass Implementation of a punctual mass element. Takes an input force and produces output position. Usage mass(m, grav, x0, xr0),_ : _ Where: m : mass value grav : gravity force value x0 : initial position xr0 : initial delayed position (inferred from initial velocity) (mi.)oscil Implementation of a simple linear harmonic oscillator. Takes an input force and produces output position. Usage oscil(m, k, z, grav, x0, xr0),_ : _ Where: m : mass value k : stiffness value z : damping value grav : gravity force value x0 : initial position xr0 : initial delayed position (inferred from initial velocity) (mi.)ground Implementation of a fixed point element. The position output produced by this module never changes, however it still expects a force input signal (for compliance with connection rules). Usage ground(x0),_ : _ Where: x0 : initial position (mi.)posInput Implementation of a position input module (driven by an outside signal). Takes two signal inputs: incoming force (which doesn't affect position) and the driving position signal. Usage posInput(x0),_,_ : _ Where: x0 : initial position Interaction Algorithms All interaction-type physical element functions are declared here. They each expect to receive two position signals (coming from the two mass-elements that they connect) and produce two equal and opposite force signals that must be routed back to the mass elements' inputs. All physical parameters are expressed in sample-rate dependant values. (mi.)spring Implementation of a linear elastic spring interaction. Usage spring(k, x1r, x2r),_,_ : _,_ Where: k : stiffness value x1r : initial delayed position of mass 1 (unused here) x2r : initial delayed position of mass 2 (unused here) (mi.)damper Implementation of a linear damper interaction. Beware: in 32bit precision mode, damping forces can become truncated if position values are not centered around zero! Usage damper(z, x1r, x2r),_,_ : _,_ Where: z : damping value x1r : initial delayed position of mass 1 x2r : initial delayed position of mass 2 (mi.)springDamper Implementation of a linear viscoelastic spring-damper interaction (a combination of the spring and damper modules). Usage springDamper(k, z, x1r, x2r),_,_ : _,_ Where: k : stiffness value z : damping value x1r : initial delayed position of mass 1 x2r : initial delayed position of mass 2 (mi.)nlSpringDamper2 Implementation of a non-linear viscoelastic spring-damper interaction containing a quadratic term (function of squared distance). Beware: at high displacements, this interaction will break numerical stability conditions ! The nlSpringDamperClipped is a safer option. Usage nlSpringDamper2(k, q, z, x1r, x2r),_,_ : _,_ Where: k : linear stiffness value q : quadratic stiffness value z : damping value x1r : initial delayed position of mass 1 x2r : initial delayed position of mass 2 (mi.)nlSpringDamper3 Implementation of a non-linear viscoelastic spring-damper interaction containing a cubic term (function of distance^3). Beware: at high displacements, this interaction will break numerical stability conditions ! The nlSpringDamperClipped is a safer option. Usage nlSpringDamper3(k, q, z, x1r, x2r),_,_ : _,_ Where: k : linear stiffness value q : cubic stiffness value z : damping value x1r : initial delayed position of mass 1 x2r : initial delayed position of mass 2 (mi.)nlSpringDamperClipped Implementation of a non-linear viscoelastic spring-damper interaction containing a cubic term (function of distance^3), bound by an upper linear stiffness (hard-clipping). This bounding means that when faced with strong displacements, the interaction profile will \"clip\" at a given point and never produce forces higher than the bounding equivalent linear spring, stopping models from becoming unstable. So far the interaction clips \"hard\" (with no soft-knee spline interpolation, etc.) Usage nlSpringDamperClipped(s, c, k, z, x1r, x2r),_,_ : _,_ Where: s : linear stiffness value c : cubic stiffness value k : upper-bound linear stiffness value z : (linear) damping value x1r : initial delayed position of mass 1 x2r : initial delayed position of mass 2 (mi.)nlPluck Implementation of a piecewise linear plucking interaction. The symmetric function provides a repulsive viscoelastic interaction upon contact, until a tipping point is reached (when the plucking occurs). The tipping point depends both on the stiffness and the distance scaling of the interaction. Usage nlPluck(knl, scale, z, x1r, x2r),_,_ : _,_ Where: knl : stiffness scaling parameter (vertical stretch of the NL function) scale : distance scaling parameter (horizontal stretch of the NL function) z : (linear) damping value x1r : initial delayed position of mass 1 x2r : initial delayed position of mass 2 (mi.)nlBow Implementation of a non-linear friction based interaction that allows for stick-slip bowing behaviour. Two versions are proposed : a piecewise linear function (very similar to the nlPluck) or a mathematical approximation (see Stefan Bilbao's book, Numerical Sound Synthesis). Usage nlBow(znl, scale, type, x1r, x2r),_,_ : _,_ Where: znl : friction scaling parameter (vertical stretch of the NL function) scale : velocity scaling parameter (horizontal stretch of the NL function) type : interaction profile (0 = piecewise linear, 1 = smooth function) x1r : initial delayed position of mass 1 x2r : initial delayed position of mass 2 (mi.)collision Implementation of a collision interaction, producing linear visco-elastic repulsion forces when two mass elements are interpenetrating. Usage collision(k, z, thres, x1r, x2r),_,_ : _,_ Where: k : collision stiffness parameter z : collision damping parameter thres : threshold distance for the contact between elements x1r : initial delayed position of mass 1 x2r : initial delayed position of mass 2 (mi.)nlCollisionClipped Implementation of a collision interaction, producing non-linear visco-elastic repulsion forces when two mass elements are interpenetrating. Bound by an upper stiffness value to maintain stability. This interaction is particularly useful for more realistic contact dynamics (greater difference in velocity provides sharper contacts, and reciprocally). Usage nlCollisionClipped(s, c, k, z, thres, x1r, x2r),_,_ : _,_ Where: s : collision linear stiffness parameter c : collision cubic stiffness parameter k : collision upper-bounding stiffness parameter z : collision damping parameter thres : threshold distance for the contact between elements x1r : initial delayed position of mass 1 x2r : initial delayed position of mass 2","title":" mi "},{"location":"libs/mi/#milib","text":"This ongoing work is the fruit of a collaboration between GRAME-CNCM and the ANIS (Arts Num\u00e9riques et Immersions Sensorielles) research group from GIPSA-Lab (Universit\u00e9 Grenoble Alpes).

Usage bus(4*N) : mesh_square(N) : bus(4*N); Where: N : number of nodes along each edge - a power of two (1,2,4,8,...) Reference https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/pasp/Digital_Waveguide_Mesh.html Signal Order In and Out The mesh is constructed recursively using 2x2 embeddings. Thus, the top level of mesh_square(M) is a block 2x2 mesh, where each block is a mesh(M/2) . Let these blocks be numbered 1,2,3,4 in the geometry NW,NE,SW,SE, i.e., as 1 2 3 4 Each block has four vector inputs and four vector outputs, where the length of each vector is M/2 . Label the input vectors as Ni,Ei,Wi,Si, i.e., as the inputs from the North, East South, and West, and similarly for the outputs. Then, for example, the upper left input block of M/2 signals is labeled 1Ni. Most of the connections are internal, such as 1Eo -> 2Wi. The 8*(M/2) input signals are grouped in the order 1Ni 2Ni 3Si 4Si 1Wi 3Wi 2Ei 4Ei and the output signals are 1No 1Wo 2No 2Eo 3So 3Wo 4So 4Eo or In: 1No 1Wo 2No 2Eo 3So 3Wo 4So 4Eo Out: 1Ni 2Ni 3Si 4Si 1Wi 3Wi 2Ei 4Ei Thus, the inputs are grouped by direction N,S,W,E, while the outputs are grouped by block number 1,2,3,4, which can also be interpreted as directions NW, NE, SW, SE. A simple program illustrating these orderings is process = mesh_square(2); . Example Reflectively terminated mesh impulsed at one corner: mesh_square_test(N,x) = mesh_square(N)~(busi(4*N,x)) // input to corner with { busi(N,x) = bus(N) : par(i,N,*(-1)) : par(i,N-1,_), +(x); }; process = 1-1' : mesh_square_test(4); // all modes excited forever In this simple example, the mesh edges are connected as follows: 1No -> 1Ni, 1Wo -> 2Ni, 2No -> 3Si, 2Eo -> 4Si, 3So -> 1Wi, 3Wo -> 3Wi, 4So -> 2Ei, 4Eo -> 4Ei A routing matrix can be used to obtain other connection geometries.

Its official prefix is pm . This library provides an environment to facilitate physical modeling of musical instruments. It contains dozens of functions implementing low and high level elements going from a simple waveguide to fully operational models with built-in UI, etc. It is organized as follows: Global Variables : useful pre-defined variables for physical modeling (e.g., speed of sound, etc.). Conversion Tools : conversion functions specific to physical modeling (e.g., length to frequency, etc.). Bidirectional Utilities : functions to create bidirectional block diagrams for physical modeling. Basic Elements : waveguides, specific types of filters, etc. String Instruments : various types of strings (e.g., steel, nylon, etc.), bridges, guitars, etc. Bowed String Instruments : parts and models specific to bowed string instruments (e.g., bows, bridges, violins, etc.). Wind Instrument : parts and models specific to wind string instruments (e.g., reeds, mouthpieces, flutes, clarinets, etc.). Exciters : pluck generators, \"blowers\", etc. Modal Percussions : percussion instruments based on modal models. Vocal Synthesis : functions for various vocal synthesis techniques (e.g., fof, source/filter, etc.) and vocal synthesizers. Misc Functions : any other functions that don't fit in the previous category (e.g., nonlinear filters, etc.). This library is part of the Faust Physical Modeling ToolKit. More information on how to use this library can be found on this page: * https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~rmichon/pmFaust . Tutorials on how to make physical models of musical instruments using Faust can be found here as well. Global Variables Useful pre-defined variables for physical modeling. (pm.)speedOfSound Speed of sound in meters per second (340m/s). (pm.)maxLength The default maximum length (3) in meters of strings and tubes used in this library. This variable should be overriden to allow longer strings or tubes. Conversion Tools Useful conversion tools for physical modeling. (pm.)f2l Frequency to length in meters. Usage f2l(freq) : distanceInMeters Where: freq : the frequency (pm.)l2f Length in meters to frequency.

Usage l2s(l) : numberOfSamples Where: l : length in meters Bidirectional Utilities Set of fundamental functions to create bi-directional block diagrams in Faust. These elements are used as the basis of this library to connect high level elements (e.g., mouthpieces, strings, bridge, instrument body, etc.). Each block has 3 inputs and 3 outputs. The first input/output carry left going waves, the second input/output carry right going waves, and the third input/output is used to carry any potential output signal to the end of the algorithm. (pm.)basicBlock Empty bidirectional block to be used with chain : 3 signals ins and 3 signals out. Usage chain(basicBlock : basicBlock : etc.) (pm.)chain Creates a chain of bidirectional blocks. Blocks must have 3 inputs and outputs. The first input/output carry left going waves, the second input/output carry right going waves, and the third input/output is used to carry any potential output signal to the end of the algorithm. The implied one sample delay created by the ~ operator is generalized to the left and right going waves. Thus, n blocks in chain() will add an n samples delay to both left and right going waves. Usage leftGoingWaves,rightGoingWaves,mixedOutput : chain( A : B ) : leftGoingWaves,rightGoingWaves,mixedOutput with{ A = _,_,_; }; (pm.)inLeftWave Adds a signal to left going waves anywhere in a chain of blocks.

(pm.)inRightWave Adds a signal to right going waves anywhere in a chain of blocks. Usage model(x) = chain(A : inRightWave(x) : B) Where A and B are bidirectional blocks and x is the signal added to right going waves in that chain. (pm.)in Adds a signal to left and right going waves anywhere in a chain of blocks. Usage model(x) = chain(A : in(x) : B) Where A and B are bidirectional blocks and x is the signal added to left and right going waves in that chain. (pm.)outLeftWave Sends the signal of left going waves to the output channel of the chain . Usage chain(A : outLeftWave : B) Where A and B are bidirectional blocks.

As for chain , this function adds a 1 sample delay to the bidirectional signal, both ways. Of course, this function can be nested within a chain . Usage terminations(a,b,c) with{ }; (pm.)lTermination Creates a termination on the left side of a chain without closing the inputs and outputs of the bidirectional signals chain.

This function adds a 1 sample delay near the termination and can be nested within another chain . Usage rTerminations(b,c) with{ }; (pm.)closeIns Closes the inputs of a bidirectional chain in all directions. Usage closeIns : chain(...) : _,_,_ (pm.)closeOuts Closes the outputs of a bidirectional chain in all directions except for the main signal output (3d output).

It is based on the block diagram in Figure 7.5. The Oberheim filter is a state-variable filter with soft-clipping distortion within the circuit. In many VA filters, distortion is accomplished using the \"tanh\" function. For this Faust implementation, that distortion function was replaced with the (ef.)cubicnl function.

Usage _ : oberheimLPF(normFreq,Q) : _ Where: normFreq : normalized frequency (0-1) Q : q Sallen Key Filters The following filters were implemented based on VA models of synthesizer filters. The modeling approach is based on a Topology Preserving Transform (TPT) to resolve the delay-free feedback loop in the corresponding analog filters. The primary processing block used to build other filters (Moog, Korg, etc.) is based on a 1st-order Sallen-Key filter. The filters included in this script are 1st-order LPF/HPF and 2nd-order state-variable filters capable of LPF, HPF, and BPF. Resources: Vadim Zavalishin (2018) \"The Art of VA Filter Design\", v2.1.0 https://www.native-instruments.com/fileadmin/ni_media/downloads/pdf/VAFilterDesign_2.1.0.pdf Will Pirkle (2014) \"Resolving Delay-Free Loops in Recursive Filters Using the Modified H\u00e4rm\u00e4 Method\", AES 137 http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=17517 Description and diagrams of 1st- and 2nd-order TPT filters: https://www.willpirkle.com/706-2/ (ve.)sallenKeyOnePole Sallen-Key generic One Pole filter that produces the LPF and HPF outputs (see description above). For the Faust implementation of this filter, recursion ( letrec ) is used for storing filter \"states\". The output (e.g. y ) is calculated by using the input signal and the previous states of the filter. During the current recursive step, the states of the filter (e.g. s ) for the next step are also calculated. Admittedly, this is not an efficient way to implement a filter because it requires independently calculating the output and each state during each recursive step. However, it works as a way to store and use \"states\" within the constraints of Faust. The simplest example is the 1st-order LPF (shown on the cover of Zavalishin * 2018 and Fig 4.3 of https://www.willpirkle.com/706-2/ ). Here, the input signal is split in parallel for the calculation of the output signal, y , and the state, s. The value of the state is only used for feedback to the next step of recursion. It is blocked (!) from also being routed to the output. A trick used for calculating the state, s, is to observe that the input to the delay block is the sum of two signal: what appears to be a feedforward path and a feedback path. In reality, the signals being summed are identical (signal*2) plus the value of the current state. Usage _ : sallenKeyOnePole(normFreq) : _,_ Where: normFreq : normalized frequency (0-1) (ve.)sallenKeyOnePoleLPF Sallen-Key One Pole lowpass filter (see description above). Specialize the generic implementation: keep the first LPF output, the compiler will only generate the needed code. Usage _ : sallenKeyOnePoleLPF(normFreq) : _ Where: normFreq : normalized frequency (0-1) (ve.)sallenKeyOnePoleHPF Sallen-Key One Pole Highpass filter (see description above). The dry input signal is routed in parallel to the output. The LPF'd signal is subtracted from the input so that the HPF remains. Specialize the generic implementation: keep the second HPF output, the compiler will only generate the needed code. Usage _ : sallenKeyOnePoleHPF(normFreq) : _ Where: normFreq : normalized frequency (0-1) (ve.)sallenKey2ndOrder Sallen-Key generic 2nd order filter that produces the LPF, BPF and HPF outputs. This is a 2nd-order Sallen-Key state-variable filter. The idea is that by \"tapping\" into different points in the circuit, different filters (LPF,BPF,HPF) can be achieved. See Figure 4.6 of * https://www.willpirkle.com/706-2/ This is also a good example of the next step for generalizing the Faust programming approach used for all these VA filters. In this case, there are three things to calculate each recursive step (y,s1,s2). For each thing, the circuit is only calculated up to that point. Comparing the LPF to BPF, the output signal (y) is calculated similarly. Except, the output of the BPF stops earlier in the circuit. Similarly, the states (s1 and s2) only differ in that s2 includes a couple more terms beyond what is used for s1.

For the Faust implementation of this filter, recursion ( letrec ) is used for storing filter \"states\". The output (e.g. y ) is calculated by using the input signal and the previous states of the filter. During the current recursive step, the states of the filter (e.g. s ) for the next step are also calculated. Admittedly, this is not an efficient way to implement a filter because it requires independently calculating the output and each state during each recursive step. However, it works as a way to store and use \"states\" within the constraints of Faust. The simplest example is the 1st-order LPF (shown on the cover of Zavalishin * 2018 and Fig 4.3 of https://www.willpirkle.com/706-2/ ). Here, the input signal is split in parallel for the calculation of the output signal, y , and the state, s. The value of the state is only used for feedback to the next step of recursion. It is blocked (!) from also being routed to the output. A trick used for calculating the state, s, is to observe that the input to the delay block is the sum of two signal: what appears to be a feedforward path and a feedback path. In reality, the signals being summed are identical (signal*2) plus the value of the current state.","title":"(ve.)sallenKeyOnePole"},{"location":"libs/vaeffects/#usage_12","text":"_ : sallenKeyOnePole(normFreq) : _,_ Where: normFreq : normalized frequency (0-1)","title":"Usage"},{"location":"libs/vaeffects/#_1","text":"","title":""},{"location":"libs/vaeffects/#vesallenkeyonepolelpf","text":"Sallen-Key One Pole lowpass filter (see description above).

Comparing the LPF to BPF, the output signal (y) is calculated similarly. Except, the output of the BPF stops earlier in the circuit.
