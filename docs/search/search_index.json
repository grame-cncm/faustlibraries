The main topics addressed are: spatial sound processing and synthesis using ambisonics, multi-channel sound processing, utility objects for mixed music. Edge of Chaos This repository contains libraries including some essential building blocks for the implementation of musical complex adaptive systems in Faust programming. It includes a set of time-domain algorithms, some of which are original, for the processing of low-level and high-level information as well as the processing of sound using standard and non-conventional techniques. It also includes functions for the realisation of networks with different topologies, linear and nonlinear mapping strategies to render positive and negative feedback relationships, and different kinds of energy-preserving techniques for the stability of self-oscillating systems. realfaust This library contains a set of functions representing domain-limited versions of all Faust primitives and math functions that can potentially generate INF or NaN values. The goal of the library is to be able to implement DSP networks that, structurally, are free from INF and NaN values. Hence, the resulting programs should be rock-solid during real-time performance and virtually immune to crashes regardless of how mercilessly a network is modulated or how unstable a recursive system is made. bitDSP-faust BitDSP is a set of Faust library functions aimed to help explore and research artistic possibilities of bit-based algorithms. BitDSP currently includes implementations of bit-based functions ranging from simple bit operations over classic delta-sigma modulations to more experimental approaches like cellular automata, recursive Boolean networks, and linear feedback shift registers. A detailed overview of the functionality is in the paper \"Creative use of bit-stream DSP in Faust\" presented at IFC 2020 . SEAM library Sustained Electro-Acoustic Music is a project inspired by Alvise Vidolin and Nicola Bernardini . The SEAM libraries have been developed for this project. Ambitools library Ambitools is an implementation of several Ambisonic tools with the FAUST language. The code is designed to be scalable and flexible, offering tools working at various Ambisonic order and compiled for various architectures. The implementation of the spherical harmonics for an efficient computation is detailed. See the Ambitools : Tools For Sound Field Synthesis With Higher Order Ambisonic - V1.0 paper.

Dependency loops must be avoided as much as possible . The resources folder contains tools to build and visualise the libraries dependencies graphs. If you wish to add a function to any of these libraries or if you plan to add a new library, make sure that you observe the following conventions: New Functions All functions must be preceded by a markdown documentation header respecting the following format (open the source code of any of the libraries for an example): //-----------------functionName-------------------- // Description // // #### Usage // // ``` // Usage Example // ``` // // Where: // // * argument1: argument 1 description //------------------------------------------------- Every time a new function is added, the documentation should be updated simply by running make doclib . The environment system (e.g. os.osc ) should be used when calling a function declared in another library (see the section on Library Import ). Try to reuse existing functions as much as possible. The Usage line must show the input/output shape (the number of inputs and outputs) of the function, like gen: _ for a mono generator, _ : filter : _ for a mono effect, etc. Some functions use parameters that are constant numerical expressions . The convention is to label them in capital letters and document them preferably to be constant numerical expressions (or known at compile time in existing libraries). Functions with several parameters should better be written by putting the more constant parameters (like control, setup...) at the beginning of the parameter list, and audio signals to be processed at the end. This allows to do partial-application. So prefer the following clip(low, high, x) = min(max(x, low), high); form where clip(-1, 1) partially applied version can be used later on in different contexts, better than clip(x, low, high) = min(max(x, low), high); version. New Libraries Any new \"standard\" library should be declared in stdfaust.lib with its own environment (2 letters - see stdfaust.lib ). Any new \"standard\" library must be added to generateDoc . Functions must be organized by sections. Any new library should at least declare a name and a version . Any new library has to use a prefix declared in the header section with the following kind of syntax: Its official prefix is 'qu' (look at an existing library to follow the exact syntax). Be sure to add the appropriate kind of ma = library(\"maths.lib\"); import library line, for each external library function used in the new library (for instance ma.foo that would be used somewhre in the code). The comment based markdown documentation of each library must respect the following format (open the source code of any of the libraries for an example): //############### libraryName ################## // Description // // * Section Name 1 // * Section Name 2 // * ... // // It should be used using the `[...]` environment: // // ``` // [...] = library(\"libraryName\"); // process = [...].functionCall; // ``` // // Another option is to import `stdfaust.lib` which already contains the `[...]` // environment: // // ``` // import(\"stdfaust.lib\"); // process = [...].functionCall; // ``` //############################################## //================= Section Name =============== // Description //============================================== Coding Conventions In order to have a uniformized library system, we established the following conventions (that hopefully will be followed by others when making modifications to them).

But list operations can be simulated (in part) using the parallel binary composition operation , and pattern matching. Thus functions expecting a variable number of arguments can use this mechanism, like a foo function that would be used this way: foo((a,b,c,d)) . See fi.iir and fi.fir examples. Documentation All the functions that we want to be \"public\" are documented. We used the faust2md \"standards\" for each library: //### for main title (library name - equivalent to # in markdown), //=== for section declarations (equivalent to ## in markdown) and //--- for function declarations (equivalent to #### in markdown - see basics.lib for an example). Sections in function documentation should be declared as #### markdown title. Each function documentation provides a \"Usage\" section (see basics.lib ). The full documentation can be generated using the doc/Makefile script. Use make help to see all possible commands. If you plan to create a pull-request, do not commit the full generated code but only the modified .lib files. Each function can have declare author \"name\"; , declare copyright \"XXX\"; and declare licence \"YYY\"; declarations. Each library has a declare version \"xx.yy.zz\"; semantic version number to be raised each time a modification is done. The global version number in version.lib also has to be adapted according to the change. Library Import To prevent cross-references between libraries, we generalized the use of the library(\"\") system for function calls in all the libraries. This means that everytime a function declared in another library is called, the environment corresponding to this library needs to be called too. To make things easier, a stdfaust.lib library was created and is imported by all the libraries: aa = library(\"aanl.lib\"); sf = library(\"all.lib\"); an = library(\"analyzers.lib\"); ba = library(\"basics.lib\"); co = library(\"compressors.lib\"); de = library(\"delays.lib\"); dm = library(\"demos.lib\"); dx = library(\"dx7.lib\"); en = library(\"envelopes.lib\"); fd = library(\"fds.lib\"); fi = library(\"filters.lib\"); ho = library(\"hoa.lib\"); it = library(\"interpolators.lib\"); la = library(\"linearalgebra.lib\"); ma = library(\"maths.lib\"); mi = library(\"mi.lib\"); ef = library(\"misceffects.lib\"); os = library(\"oscillators.lib\"); no = library(\"noises.lib\"); pf = library(\"phaflangers.lib\"); pm = library(\"physmodels.lib\"); qu = library(\"quantizers.lib\"); rm = library(\"reducemaps.lib\"); re = library(\"reverbs.lib\"); ro = library(\"routes.lib\"); si = library(\"signals.lib\"); so = library(\"soundfiles.lib\"); sp = library(\"spats.lib\"); sy = library(\"synths.lib\"); ve = library(\"vaeffects.lib\"); vl = library(\"version.lib\"); wa = library(\"webaudio.lib\"); wd = library(\"wdmodels.lib\"); For example, if we wanted to use the smooth function which is now declared in signals.lib , we would do the following: import(\"stdfaust.lib\"); process = si.smooth(0.999); This standard is only used within the libraries: nothing prevents coders to still import signals.lib directly and call smooth without ro. , etc. It means symbols and function names defined within a library have to be unique to not collide with symbols of any other libraries . \"Demo\" Functions \"Demo\" functions are placed in demos.lib and have a built-in user interface (UI). Their name ends with the _demo suffix. Each of these function have a .dsp file associated to them in the /examples folder. Any function containing UI elements should be placed in this library and respect these standards. \"Standard\" Functions \"Standard\" functions are here to simplify the life of new (or not so new) Faust coders. They are declared in /libraries/doc/standardFunctions.md and allow to point programmers to preferred functions to carry out a specific task. For example, there are many different types of lowpass filters declared in filters.lib and only one of them is considered to be standard, etc. Testing the library Before preparing a pull-request, the new library must be carefully tested: all functions defined in the library must be tested by preparing a DSP test program the compatibilty library all.lib imports all libraries in a same namespace, so check functions names collisions using the following test program: import(\"all.lib\"); process = _; Library deployment For GRAME maintainers: regenerate the PDF documentation using make pdf target in the doc folder update the library submodule in faust , recompile and deploy WebAssembly libfaust in fausteditor , faustplayground and faustide update the library submodule in faustlive update the library list in this fausteditor page as well as the snippets (using the faust2atomsnippets tool). update the library list in this faustide page. update the library list in the faustgen~ code update the Faust Syntax Highlighting Files make an update PR for vscode-faust project","title":" Contributing "},{"location":"contributing/#contributing","text":"In general, libraries are organised in a stacked manner : the base ones define functions or constants without any dependancies, and additional ones are gradually built on top of simpler ones, layer by layer.

nonlinearities. Its official prefix is aa . This library provides aliasing-suppressed nonlinearities through first-order and second-order approximations of continuous-time signals, functions, and convolution based on antiderivatives. This technique is particularly effective if combined with low-factor oversampling, for example, operating at 96 kHz or 192 kHz sample-rate. The library contains trigonometric functions as well as other nonlinear functions such as bounded and unbounded saturators. Due to their limited domains or ranges, some of these functions may not suitable for audio nonlinear processing or waveshaping, although they have been included for completeness. Some other functions, for example, tan() and tanh(), are only available with first-order antialiasing due to the complexity of the antiderivative of the x * f(x) term, particularly because of the necessity of the dilogarithm function, which requires special implementation. Future improvements to this library may include an adaptive mechanism to set the ill-conditioned cases threshold to improve performance in varying cases. Note that the antialiasing functions introduce a delay in the path, respectively half and one-sample delay for first and second-order functions. Also note that due to division by differences, it is vital to use double-precision or more to reduce errors. The environment identifier for this library is aa . After importing the standard libraries in Faust, the functions below can be called as aa.function_name .

If the input is only slightly saturated, hence producing negligible aliasing, the trivial saturator may result in a better overall output, as noise can be introduced by first and second ADAA at low amplitudes. Once determining the lowest saturation level for which the antialiased functions perform adequately, it might be sensible to cross-fade between the trivial and the antialiased saturators according to the amplitude profile of the input signal.

It outputs an index between 0 and 1 at a desired analysis frame. The ZCR of a signal correlates with the noisiness [Gouyon et al. 2000] and the spectral centroid [Herrera-Boyer et al. 2006] of a signal. For sinusoidal signals, the ZCR can be multiplied by ma.SR/2 and used as a frequency detector. For example, it can be deployed as a computationally efficient adaptive mechanism for automatic Larsen suppression. Usage _ : zcr(tau) : _ Where: tau : (time to decay by e^-1) sets the averaging frame in seconds. Adaptive Frequency Analysis (an.)pitchTracker This function implements a pitch-tracking algorithm by means of zero-crossing rate analysis and adaptive low-pass filtering. The design is based on the algorithm described in this tutorial (section 2.2) . Usage _ : pitchTracker(N, tau) : _ Where: N : a constant numerical expression, sets the order of the low-pass filter, which determines the sensitivity of the algorithm for signals where partials are stronger than the fundamental frequency. tau : response time in seconds based on exponentially-weighted averaging with tau time-constant. See https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/st/Exponentials.html . (an.)spectralCentroid This function implements a time-domain spectral centroid by means of RMS measurements and adaptive crossover filtering. The weight difference of the upper and lower spectral powers are used to recursively adjust the crossover cutoff so that the system (minimally) oscillates around a balancing point. Unlike block processing techniques such as FFT, this algorithm provides continuous measurements and fast response times. Furthermore, when providing input signals that are spectrally sparse, the algorithm will output a logarithmic measure of the centroid, which is perceptually desirable for musical applications. For example, if the input signal is the combination of three tones at 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz, the centroid will be the middle octave. Usage _ : spectralCentroid(nonlinearity, tau) : _ Where: nonlinearity : a boolean to activate or deactivate nonlinear integration. The nonlinear function is useful to improve stability with very short response times such as .001 <= tau <= .005 , otherwise, the nonlinearity may reduce precision. tau : response time in seconds based on exponentially-weighted averaging with tau time-constant.

Example: process = os.osc(500) + os.osc(1000) + os.osc(2000) + os.osc(4000) + os.osc(8000) : an.spectralCentroid(1, .001); Spectrum-Analyzers Spectrum-analyzers split the input signal into a bank of parallel signals, one for each spectral band. They are related to the Mth-Octave Filter-Banks in filters.lib . The documentation of this library contains more details about the implementation. The parameters are: M : number of band-slices per octave (>1) N : total number of bands (>2) ftop = upper bandlimit of the Mth-octave bands (<SR/2) In addition to the Mth-octave output signals, there is a highpass signal containing frequencies from ftop to SR/2, and a \"dc band\" lowpass signal containing frequencies from 0 (dc) up to the start of the Mth-octave bands. Thus, the N output signals are: highpass(ftop), MthOctaveBands(M,N-2,ftop), dcBand(ftop*2^(-M*(N-1))) A Spectrum-Analyzer is defined here as any band-split whose bands span the relevant spectrum, but whose band-signals do not necessarily sum to the original signal, either exactly or to within an allpass filtering. Spectrum analyzer outputs are normally at least nearly \"power complementary\", i.e., the power spectra of the individual bands sum to the original power spectrum (to within some negligible tolerance).

Lists are simulated with parallel compositions and there is no empty list. Function tabulation The purpose of function tabulation is to speed up the computation of heavy functions over an interval, so that the computation at runtime can be faster than directly using the function. Two techniques are implemented: tabulate computes the function in a table and read the points using interpolation. tabulateNd is the N dimensions version of tabulate tabulate_chebychev uses Chebyshev polynomial approximation Comparison program example process = line(50000, r0, r1) <: FX-tb,FX-ch : par(i, 2, maxerr) with { C = 0; FX = sin; NX = 50; CD = 3; r0 = 0; r1 = ma.PI; tb(x) = ba.tabulate(C, FX, NX*(CD+1), r0, r1, x).cub; ch(x) = ba.tabulate_chebychev(C, FX, NX, CD, r0, r1, x); maxerr = abs : max ~ _; line(n, x0, x1) = x0 + (ba.time%n)/n * (x1-x0); }; (ba.)tabulate Tabulate a 1D function over the range [r0, r1] for access via nearest-value, linear, cubic interpolation. In other words, the uniformly tabulated function can be evaluated using interpolation of order 0 (none), 1 (linear), or 3 (cubic). Usage tabulate(C, FX, S, r0, r1, x).(val|lin|cub) : _ C : whether to dynamically force the x value to the range [r0, r1]: 1 forces the check, 0 deactivates it (constant numerical expression) FX : unary function Y=F(X) with one output (scalar function of one variable) S : size of the table in samples (constant numerical expression) r0 : minimum value of argument x r1 : maximum value of argument x tabulate(C, FX, S, r0, r1, x).val uses the value in the table closest to x tabulate(C, FX, S, r0, r1, x).lin evaluates at x using linear interpolation between the closest stored values tabulate(C, FX, S, r0, r1, x).cub evaluates at x using cubic interpolation between the closest stored values Example test program midikey2hz(mk) = ba.tabulate(1, ba.midikey2hz, 512, 0, 127, mk).lin; process = midikey2hz(ba.time), ba.midikey2hz(ba.time); (ba.)tabulate_chebychev Tabulate a 1D function over the range [r0, r1] for access via Chebyshev polynomial approximation. In contrast to (ba.)tabulate , which interpolates only between tabulated samples, (ba.)tabulate_chebychev stores coefficients of Chebyshev polynomials that are evaluated to provide better approximations in many cases. Two new arguments controlling this are NX, the number of segments into which [r0, r1] is divided, and CD, the maximum Chebyshev polynomial degree to use for each segment. A rdtable of size NX*(CD+1) is internally used. Note that processing r1 the last point in the interval is not safe. So either be sure the input stays in [r0, r1[ or use C = 1 . Usage _ : tabulate_chebychev(C, FX, NX, CD, r0, r1) : _ C : whether to dynamically force the value to the range [r0, r1]: 1 forces the check, 0 deactivates it (constant numerical expression) FX : unary function Y=F(X) with one output (scalar function of one variable) NX : number of segments for uniformly partitioning [r0, r1] (constant numerical expression) CD : maximum polynomial degree for each Chebyshev polynomial (constant numerical expression) r0 : minimum value of argument x r1 : maximum value of argument x Example test program midikey2hz_chebychev(mk) = ba.tabulate_chebychev(1, ba.midikey2hz, 100, 4, 0, 127, mk); process = midikey2hz_chebychev(ba.time), ba.midikey2hz(ba.time); (ba.)tabulateNd Tabulate an nD function for access via nearest-value or linear or cubic interpolation. In other words, the tabulated function can be evaluated using interpolation of order 0 (none), 1 (linear), or 3 (cubic). The table size and parameter range of each dimension can and must be separately specified. You can use it anywhere you have an expensive function with multiple parameters with known ranges. You could use it to build a wavetable synth, for example. The number of dimensions is deduced from the number of parameters you give, see below. Note that processing the last point in each interval is not safe. So either be sure the inputs stay in their respective ranges, or use C = 1 . Similarly for the first point when doing cubic interpolation. Usage tabulateNd(C, function, (parameters) ).(val|lin|cub) : _ C : whether to dynamically force the parameter values for each dimension to the ranges specified in parameters: 1 forces the check, 0 deactivates it (constant numerical expression) function : the function we want to tabulate. Can have any number of inputs, but needs to have just one output. (parameters) : sizes, ranges and read values. Note: these need to be in brackets, to make them one entity. If N is the number of dimensions, we need: N times S : number of values to store for this dimension (constant numerical expression) N times r0 : minimum value of this dimension N times r1 : maximum value of this dimension N times x : read value of this dimension By providing these parameters, you indirectly specify the number of dimensions; it's the number of parameters divided by 4. The user facing functions are: tabulateNd(C, function, S, parameters).val Uses the value in the table closest to x. tabulateNd(C, function, S, parameters).lin Evaluates at x using linear interpolation between the closest stored values. tabulateNd(C, function, S, parameters).cub Evaluates at x using cubic interpolation between the closest stored values. Example test program powSin(x,y) = sin(pow(x,y)); // The function we want to tabulate powSinTable(x,y) = ba.tabulateNd(1, powSin, (sizeX,sizeY, rx0,ry0, rx1,ry1, x,y) ).lin; sizeX = 512; // table size of the first parameter sizeY = 512; // table size of the second parameter rx0 = 2; // start of the range of the first parameter ry0 = 2; // start of the range of the second parameter rx1 = 10; // end of the range of the first parameter ry1 = 10; // end of the range of the second parameter x = hslider(\"x\", rx0, rx0, rx1, 0.001):si.smoo; y = hslider(\"y\", ry0, ry0, ry1, 0.001):si.smoo; process = powSinTable(x,y), powSin(x,y); Working principle The .val function just outputs the closest stored value. The .lin and .cub functions interpolate in N dimensions. Multi dimensional interpolation To understand what it means to interpolate in N dimensions, here's a quick reminder on the general principle of 2D linear interpolation: We have a grid of values, and we want to find the value at a point (x, y) within this grid. We first find the four closest points (A, B, C, D) in the grid surrounding the point (x, y). Then, we perform linear interpolation in the x-direction between points A and B, and between points C and D. This gives us two new points E and F. Finally, we perform linear interpolation in the y-direction between points E and F to get our value. To implement this in Faust, we need N sequential groups of interpolators, where N is the number of dimensions. Each group feeds into the next, with the last \"group\" being a single interpolator, and the group before it containing one interpolator for each input of the group it's feeding. Some examples: Our 2D linear example has two interpolators feeding into one. A 3D linear interpolator has four interpolators feeding into two, feeding into one. A 2D cubic interpolater has four interpolators feeding into one. A 3D cubic interpolator has sixteen interpolators feeding into four, feeding into one. To understand which values we need to look up, let's consider the 2D linear example again. The four values going into the first group represent the four closest points (A, B, C, D) mentioned above. 1) The first interpolator gets: The closest value that is stored (A) The next value in the x dimension, keeping y fixed (B) 2) The second interpolator gets: One step over in the y dimension, keeping x fixed (C) One step over in both the x dimension and the y dimension (D) The outputs of these two interpolators are points E and F. In other words: the interpolated x values and, respectively, the following y values: The closest stored value of the y dimension One step forward in the y dimension The last interpolator takes these two values and interpolates them in the y dimension. To generalize for N dimensions and linear interpolation: The first group has 2^(n-1) parallel interpolators interpolating in the first dimension. The second group has 2^(n-2) parallel interpolators interpolating in the second dimension. The process continues until the n-th group, which has a single interpolator interpolating in the n-th dimension. The same principle applies to the cubic interpolation in nD. The only difference is that there would be 4^(n-1) parallel interpolators in the first group, compared to 2^(n-1) for linear interpolation. This is what the mixers function does. Besides the values, each interpolator also needs to know the weight of each value in it's output. Let's call this d , like in ba.interpolate . It is the same for each group of interpolators, since it correlates to a dimension. It's value is calculated the similarly to ba.interpolate : First we prepare a \"float table read-index\" for that dimension ( id in ba.tabulate ) If the table only had that dimension and it could read a float index, what would it be. Then we int the float index to get the value we have stored that is closest to, but lower than the input value; the actual index for that dimension. Our d is the difference between the float index and the actual index. The ids function calculates the id for each dimension and inside the mixer function they get turned into d s. Storage method The elephant in the room is: how do we get these indexes? For that we need to know how the values are stored. We use one big table to store everything. To understand the concept, let's look at the 2D example again, and then we'll extend it to 3d and the general nD case. Let's say we have a 2D table with dimensions A and B where: A has 3 values between 0 and 5 and B has 4 values between 0 and 1. The 1D array representation of this 2D table will have a size of 3 * 4 = 12. The values are stored in the following way: First 3 values: A is 0, then 3, then 5 while B is at 0. Next 3 values: A changes from 0 to 5 while B is at 1/3. Next 3 values: A changes from 0 to 5 while B is at 2/3. Last 3 values: A changes from 0 to 5 while B is at 1. For the 3D example, let's extend the 2D example with an additional dimension C having 2 values between 0 and 2. The total size will be 3 * 4 * 2 = 24. The values are stored like so: First 3 values: A changes from 0 to 5, B is at 0, and C is at 0. Next 3 values: A changes from 0 to 5, B is at 1/3, and C is at 0. Next 3 values: A changes from 0 to 5, B is at 2/3, and C is at 0. Next 3 values: A changes from 0 to 5, B is at 1, and C is at 0. The last 12 values are the same as the first 12, but with C at 2. For the general n-dimensional case, we iterate through all dimensions, changing the values of the innermost dimension first, then moving towards the outer dimensions. Read indexes To get the float read index ( id ) corresponding to a particular dimension, we scale the function input value to be between 0 and 1, and multiply it by the size of that dimension minus one. To understand how we get the readIndex for .val , let's work trough how we'd do it in our 2D linear example. For simplicity's sake, the ranges of the inputs to our function are both 0 to 1. Say we wanted to read the value closest to x=0.5 and y=0 , so the id of x is 1 (the second value) and the id of y is 0 (first value). In this case, the read index is just the id of x , rounded to the nearest integer, just like in ba.tabulate . If we want to read the value belonging to x=0.5 and y=2/3 , things get more complicated. The id for y is now 2 , the third value. For each step in the y direction, we need to increase the index by 3 , the number of values that are stored for x . So the influence of the y is: the size of x times the rounded id of y . The final read index is the rounded id of x plus the influence of y . For the general nD case, we need to do the same operation N times, each feeding into the next. This operation is the riN function. We take four parameters: the size of the dimension before it prevSize , the index of the previous dimension prevIX , the current size sizeX and the current id idX . riN has 2 outputs, the size, for feeding into the next dimension's prevSize , and the read index feeding into the next dimension's prevIX . The size is the sizeX times prevSize . The read index is the rounded idX times prevSize added to the prevIX . Our final readIndex is the read index output of the last dimension. To get the read values for the interpolators need a pattern of offsets in each dimension, since we are looking for the read indexes surrounding the point of interest. These offsets are best explained by looking at the code of tabulate2d , the hardcoded 2D version: tabulate2d(C,function, sizeX,sizeY, rx0,ry0, rx1,ry1, x,y) = environment { size = sizeX*sizeY; // Maximum X index to access midX = sizeX-1; // Maximum Y index to access midY = sizeY-1; // Maximum total index to access mid = size-1; // Create the table wf = function(wfX,wfY); // Prepare the 'float' table read index for X idX = (x-rx0)/(rx1-rx0)*midX; // Prepare the 'float' table read index for Y idY = ((y-ry0)/(ry1-ry0))*midY; // table creation X: wfX = rx0+float(ba.time%sizeX)*(rx1-rx0) /float(midX); // table creation Y: wfY = ry0+ ((float(ba.time-(ba.time%sizeX)) /float(sizeX)) *(ry1-ry0)) /float(midY); // Limit the table read index in [0, mid] if C = 1 rid(x,mid, 0) = x; rid(x,mid, 1) = max(0, min(x, mid)); // Tabulate a binary 'FX' function on a range [rx0, rx1] [ry0, ry1] val(x,y) = rdtable(size, wf, readIndex); readIndex = rid( rid(int(idX+0.5),midX, C) +yOffset , mid, C); yOffset = sizeX*rid(int(idY),midY,C); // Tabulate a binary 'FX' function over the range [rx0, rx1] [ry0, ry1] with linear interpolation lin = it.interpolate_linear( dy , it.interpolate_linear(dx,v0,v1) , it.interpolate_linear(dx,v2,v3)) with { i0 = rid(int(idX), midX, C)+yOffset; i1 = i0+1; i2 = i0+sizeX; i3 = i1+sizeX; dx = idX-int(idX); dy = idY-int(idY); v0 = rdtable(size, wf, rid(i0, mid, C)); v1 = rdtable(size, wf, rid(i1, mid, C)); v2 = rdtable(size, wf, rid(i2, mid, C)); v3 = rdtable(size, wf, rid(i3, mid, C)); }; // Tabulate a binary 'FX' function over the range [rx0, rx1] [ry0, ry1] with cubic interpolation cub = it.interpolate_cubic( dy , it.interpolate_cubic(dx,v0,v1,v2,v3) , it.interpolate_cubic(dx,v4,v5,v6,v7) , it.interpolate_cubic(dx,v8,v9,v10,v11) , it.interpolate_cubic(dx,v12,v13,v14,v15) ) with { i0 = i4-sizeX; i1 = i5-sizeX; i2 = i6-sizeX; i3 = i7-sizeX; i4 = i5-1; i5 = rid(int(idX), midX, C)+yOffset; i6 = i5+1; i7 = i6+1; i8 = i4+sizeX; i9 = i5+sizeX; i10 = i6+sizeX; i11 = i7+sizeX; i12 = i4+(2*sizeX); i13 = i5+(2*sizeX); i14 = i6+(2*sizeX); i15 = i7+(2*sizeX); dx = idX-int(idX); dy = idY-int(idY); v0 = rdtable(size, wf, rid(i0 , mid, C)); v1 = rdtable(size, wf, rid(i1 , mid, C)); v2 = rdtable(size, wf, rid(i2 , mid, C)); v3 = rdtable(size, wf, rid(i3 , mid, C)); v4 = rdtable(size, wf, rid(i4 , mid, C)); v5 = rdtable(size, wf, rid(i5 , mid, C)); v6 = rdtable(size, wf, rid(i6 , mid, C)); v7 = rdtable(size, wf, rid(i7 , mid, C)); v8 = rdtable(size, wf, rid(i8 , mid, C)); v9 = rdtable(size, wf, rid(i9 , mid, C)); v10 = rdtable(size, wf, rid(i10, mid, C)); v11 = rdtable(size, wf, rid(i11, mid, C)); v12 = rdtable(size, wf, rid(i12, mid, C)); v13 = rdtable(size, wf, rid(i13, mid, C)); v14 = rdtable(size, wf, rid(i14, mid, C)); v15 = rdtable(size, wf, rid(i15, mid, C)); }; }; In the interest of brevity, we'll stop explaining here.

NUM_BUSES : number of buses (int, known at compile time). id : index of the bus to select (int, 0<=id<NUM_BUSES ) (ba.)selectxbus Like ba.selectbus , but with a cross-fade when selecting the bus using the same technique than ba.selectmulti .

(ba.)peakholder While peak-holder functions are scarcely discussed in the literature (please do send me an email if you know otherwise), common sense tells that the expected behaviour should be as follows: the absolute value of the input signal is compared with the output of the peak-holder; if the input is greater or equal to the output, a new peak is detected and sent to the output; otherwise, a timer starts and the current peak is held for N samples; once the timer is out and no new peaks have been detected, the absolute value of the current input becomes the new peak.

Usage hslider(...) : automat(t, size, init) : _ Where: t : tempo in BPM size : number of items in the loop init : init value in the loop (ba.)bpf bpf is an environment (a group of related definitions) that can be used to create break-point functions. It contains three functions: start(x,y) to start a break-point function end(x,y) to end a break-point function point(x,y) to add intermediate points to a break-point function, using linear interpolation A minimal break-point function must contain at least a start and an end point: f = bpf.start(x0,y0) : bpf.end(x1,y1); A more involved break-point function can contains any number of intermediate points: f = bpf.start(x0,y0) : bpf.point(x1,y1) : bpf.point(x2,y2) : bpf.end(x3,y3); In any case the x_{i} must be in increasing order (for all i , x_{i} < x_{i+1} ). For example the following definition: f = bpf.start(x0,y0) : ... : bpf.point(xi,yi) : ... : bpf.end(xn,yn); implements a break-point function f such that: f(x) = y_{0} when x < x_{0} f(x) = y_{n} when x > x_{n} f(x) = y_{i} + (y_{i+1}-y_{i})*(x-x_{i})/(x_{i+1}-x_{i}) when x_{i} <= x and x < x_{i+1} In addition to bpf.point , there are also step and curve functions: step(x,y) to add a flat section step_end(x,y) to end with a flat section curve(B,x,y) to add a curved section curve_end(B,x,y) to end with a curved section These functions can be combined with the other bpf functions. Here's an example using bpf.step : f(x) = x : bpf.start(0,0) : bpf.step(.2,.3) : bpf.step(.4,.6) : bpf.step_end(1,1); For x < 0.0 , the output is 0.0. For 0.0 <= x < 0.2 , the output is 0.0. For 0.2 <= x < 0.4 , the output is 0.3. For 0.4 <= x < 1.0 , the output is 0.6. For 1.0 <= x , the output is 1.0 For the curve functions, B (compile-time constant) is a \"bias\" value strictly greater than zero and less than or equal to 1. When B is 0.5, the output curve is exactly linear and equivalent to bpf.point . When B is less than 0.5, the output is biased towards the y value of the previous breakpoint. When B is greater than 0.5, the output is biased towards the y value of the curve breakpoint. Here's an example: f = bpf.start(0,0) : bpf.curve(.15,.5,.5) : bpf.curve_end(.85,1,1); In the following example, the output is biased towards zero (the latter y value) instead of being a linear ramp from 1 to 0. f = bpf.start(0,1) : bpf.curve_end(.9,1,0); bpf is a standard Faust function. (ba.)listInterp Linearly interpolates between the elements of a list.

Usage _ : bypass1(bpc,e) : _ Where: bpc : bypass switch (0/1) e : a mono effect (ba.)bypass2 Takes a stereo input signal, route it to e and bypass it if bpc = 1 . When bypassed, e is feed with zeros so that its state is cleanup up. bypass2 is a standard Faust function. Usage _,_ : bypass2(bpc,e) : _,_ Where: bpc : bypass switch (0/1) e : a stereo effect (ba.)bypass1to2 Bypass switch for effect e having mono input signal and stereo output. Effect e is bypassed if bpc = 1 .When bypassed, e is feed with zeros so that its state is cleanup up. bypass1to2 is a standard Faust function. Usage _ : bypass1to2(bpc,e) : _,_ Where: bpc : bypass switch (0/1) e : a mono-to-stereo effect (ba.)bypass_fade Bypass an arbitrary (N x N) circuit with 'n' samples crossfade. Inputs and outputs signals are faded out when 'e' is bypassed, so that 'e' state is cleanup up. Once bypassed the effect is replaced by par(i,N,_) . Bypassed circuits can be chained.

Usage _ : bitcrusher(nbits) : _ Where: nbits : the number of bits of the wanted resolution (ba.)mulaw_bitcrusher Produce distortion by reducing the signal resolution using \u03bc-law compression. Usage _ : mulaw_bitcrusher(mu,nbits) : _ Where: mu : controls the degree of \u03bc-law compression, larger values result in stronger compression nbits : the number of bits of the wanted resolution Description The mulaw_bitcrusher applies a combination of \u03bc-law compression, quantization, and expansion to create a non-linear bitcrushed effect. This method retains finer detail in lower-amplitude signals compared to linear bitcrushing, making it suitable for creative sound design. Theory \u03bc-law Compression : emphasizes lower-amplitude signals by applying a logarithmic curve to the signal. The formula used is: F(x) = ma.signum(x) * log(1 + mu * abs(x)) / log(1 + mu); Quantization : reduces the signal resolution to nbits by rounding values to the nearest step within the specified bit depth. \u03bc-law Expansion : reverses the compression applied earlier to restore the signal to its original dynamic range: F\u207b\u00b9(y) = ma.signum(y) * (pow(1 + mu, abs(y)) - 1) / mu; Example test program process = os.osc(440) : mulaw_bitcrusher(255, 8); In this example, a sine wave at 440 Hz is passed through the \u03bc-law bitcrusher, with a compression parameter mu of 255 and 8-bit quantization. This creates a distorted, \"lo-fi\" effect.

Using the same trick for values 4 trough 7, we can write: efficientMax(x)= ( ( max(x@0,x@1), max(x@0,x@1)@2 ) :max ), ( ( max(x@0,x@1), max(x@0,x@1)@2 ) :max@4 ) :max; We can rewrite it recursively, so it becomes possible to get the maximum at have any number of values, as long as it's a power of 2. recursiveMax = case { (1,x) => x; (N,x) => max(recursiveMax(N/2,x), recursiveMax(N/2,x)@(N/2)); }; What if we want to look at a number of values that's not a power of 2? For each value, we will have to decide whether to use it or not. If n is bigger than the index of the value, we use it, otherwise we replace it with ( 0-(ma.MAX) ): variableMax(n,x) = max( max( ( (x@0 : useVal(0)), (x@1 : useVal(1)) ):max, ( (x@2 : useVal(2)), (x@3 : useVal(3)) ):max ), max( ( (x@4 : useVal(4)), (x@5 : useVal(5)) ):max, ( (x@6 : useVal(6)), (x@7 : useVal(7)) ):max ) ) with { useVal(i) = select2((n>=i) , (0-(ma.MAX)),_); }; Now it becomes impossible to re-use any values. To fix that let's first look at how we'd implement it using recursiveMax, but with a fixed n that is not a power of 2. For example, this is how you'd do it with n=3 : binaryMaxThree(x) = ( recursiveMax(1,x)@0, // the first x recursiveMax(2,x)@1 // the second and third x ):max; n=6 binaryMaxSix(x) = ( recursiveMax(2,x)@0, // first two recursiveMax(4,x)@2 // third trough sixth ):max; Note that recursiveMax(2,x) is used at a different delay then in binaryMaxThree , since it represents 1 and 2, not 2 and 3. Each block is delayed the combined size of the previous blocks. n=7 binaryMaxSeven(x) = ( ( recursiveMax(1,x)@0, // first x recursiveMax(2,x)@1 // second and third ):max, ( recursiveMax(4,x)@3 // fourth trough seventh ) ):max; To make a variable version, we need to know which powers of two are used, and at which delay time. Then it becomes a matter of: lining up all the different block sizes in parallel: sequentialOperatorParOut() delaying each the appropriate amount: sumOfPrevBlockSizes() turning it on or off: useVal() getting the maximum of all of them: parallelOp() In Faust, we can only do that for a fixed maximum number of values: maxN , known at compile time. (ba.)slidingReduce Fold-like high order function. Apply a commutative binary operation op to the last n consecutive samples of a signal x . For example : slidingReduce(max,128,128,0-(ma.MAX)) will compute the maximum of the last 128 samples. The output is updated each sample, unlike reduce, where the output is constant for the duration of a block. Usage _ : slidingReduce(op,n,maxN,disabledVal) : _ Where: n : the number of values to process maxN : the maximum number of values to process (int, known at compile time, maxN > 0) op : the operator. Needs to be a commutative one. disabledVal : the value to use when we want to ignore a value. In other words, op(x,disabledVal) should equal to x . For example, +(x,0) equals x and min(x,ma.MAX) equals x . So if we want to calculate the sum, we need to give 0 as disabledVal , and if we want the minimum, we need to give ma.MAX as disabledVal .

The .lin and .cub functions interpolate in N dimensions.","title":"Working principle"},{"location":"libs/basics/#multi-dimensional-interpolation","text":"To understand what it means to interpolate in N dimensions, here's a quick reminder on the general principle of 2D linear interpolation: We have a grid of values, and we want to find the value at a point (x, y) within this grid. We first find the four closest points (A, B, C, D) in the grid surrounding the point (x, y). Then, we perform linear interpolation in the x-direction between points A and B, and between points C and D. This gives us two new points E and F. Finally, we perform linear interpolation in the y-direction between points E and F to get our value. To implement this in Faust, we need N sequential groups of interpolators, where N is the number of dimensions. Each group feeds into the next, with the last \"group\" being a single interpolator, and the group before it containing one interpolator for each input of the group it's feeding. Some examples: Our 2D linear example has two interpolators feeding into one. A 3D linear interpolator has four interpolators feeding into two, feeding into one. A 2D cubic interpolater has four interpolators feeding into one. A 3D cubic interpolator has sixteen interpolators feeding into four, feeding into one. To understand which values we need to look up, let's consider the 2D linear example again. The four values going into the first group represent the four closest points (A, B, C, D) mentioned above. 1) The first interpolator gets: The closest value that is stored (A) The next value in the x dimension, keeping y fixed (B) 2) The second interpolator gets: One step over in the y dimension, keeping x fixed (C) One step over in both the x dimension and the y dimension (D) The outputs of these two interpolators are points E and F. In other words: the interpolated x values and, respectively, the following y values: The closest stored value of the y dimension One step forward in the y dimension The last interpolator takes these two values and interpolates them in the y dimension. To generalize for N dimensions and linear interpolation: The first group has 2^(n-1) parallel interpolators interpolating in the first dimension. The second group has 2^(n-2) parallel interpolators interpolating in the second dimension. The process continues until the n-th group, which has a single interpolator interpolating in the n-th dimension. The same principle applies to the cubic interpolation in nD. The only difference is that there would be 4^(n-1) parallel interpolators in the first group, compared to 2^(n-1) for linear interpolation. This is what the mixers function does. Besides the values, each interpolator also needs to know the weight of each value in it's output. Let's call this d , like in ba.interpolate . It is the same for each group of interpolators, since it correlates to a dimension. It's value is calculated the similarly to ba.interpolate : First we prepare a \"float table read-index\" for that dimension ( id in ba.tabulate ) If the table only had that dimension and it could read a float index, what would it be. Then we int the float index to get the value we have stored that is closest to, but lower than the input value; the actual index for that dimension. Our d is the difference between the float index and the actual index. The ids function calculates the id for each dimension and inside the mixer function they get turned into d s.","title":"Multi dimensional interpolation"},{"location":"libs/basics/#storage-method","text":"The elephant in the room is: how do we get these indexes? For that we need to know how the values are stored. We use one big table to store everything. To understand the concept, let's look at the 2D example again, and then we'll extend it to 3d and the general nD case. Let's say we have a 2D table with dimensions A and B where: A has 3 values between 0 and 5 and B has 4 values between 0 and 1. The 1D array representation of this 2D table will have a size of 3 * 4 = 12. The values are stored in the following way: First 3 values: A is 0, then 3, then 5 while B is at 0. Next 3 values: A changes from 0 to 5 while B is at 1/3. Next 3 values: A changes from 0 to 5 while B is at 2/3. Last 3 values: A changes from 0 to 5 while B is at 1. For the 3D example, let's extend the 2D example with an additional dimension C having 2 values between 0 and 2. The total size will be 3 * 4 * 2 = 24. The values are stored like so: First 3 values: A changes from 0 to 5, B is at 0, and C is at 0. Next 3 values: A changes from 0 to 5, B is at 1/3, and C is at 0. Next 3 values: A changes from 0 to 5, B is at 2/3, and C is at 0. Next 3 values: A changes from 0 to 5, B is at 1, and C is at 0. The last 12 values are the same as the first 12, but with C at 2. For the general n-dimensional case, we iterate through all dimensions, changing the values of the innermost dimension first, then moving towards the outer dimensions.","title":"Storage method"},{"location":"libs/basics/#read-indexes","text":"To get the float read index ( id ) corresponding to a particular dimension, we scale the function input value to be between 0 and 1, and multiply it by the size of that dimension minus one. To understand how we get the readIndex for .val , let's work trough how we'd do it in our 2D linear example. For simplicity's sake, the ranges of the inputs to our function are both 0 to 1. Say we wanted to read the value closest to x=0.5 and y=0 , so the id of x is 1 (the second value) and the id of y is 0 (first value). In this case, the read index is just the id of x , rounded to the nearest integer, just like in ba.tabulate . If we want to read the value belonging to x=0.5 and y=2/3 , things get more complicated. The id for y is now 2 , the third value. For each step in the y direction, we need to increase the index by 3 , the number of values that are stored for x . So the influence of the y is: the size of x times the rounded id of y . The final read index is the rounded id of x plus the influence of y . For the general nD case, we need to do the same operation N times, each feeding into the next. This operation is the riN function. We take four parameters: the size of the dimension before it prevSize , the index of the previous dimension prevIX , the current size sizeX and the current id idX . riN has 2 outputs, the size, for feeding into the next dimension's prevSize , and the read index feeding into the next dimension's prevIX . The size is the sizeX times prevSize . The read index is the rounded idX times prevSize added to the prevIX . Our final readIndex is the read index output of the last dimension. To get the read values for the interpolators need a pattern of offsets in each dimension, since we are looking for the read indexes surrounding the point of interest. These offsets are best explained by looking at the code of tabulate2d , the hardcoded 2D version: tabulate2d(C,function, sizeX,sizeY, rx0,ry0, rx1,ry1, x,y) = environment { size = sizeX*sizeY; // Maximum X index to access midX = sizeX-1; // Maximum Y index to access midY = sizeY-1; // Maximum total index to access mid = size-1; // Create the table wf = function(wfX,wfY); // Prepare the 'float' table read index for X idX = (x-rx0)/(rx1-rx0)*midX; // Prepare the 'float' table read index for Y idY = ((y-ry0)/(ry1-ry0))*midY; // table creation X: wfX = rx0+float(ba.time%sizeX)*(rx1-rx0) /float(midX); // table creation Y: wfY = ry0+ ((float(ba.time-(ba.time%sizeX)) /float(sizeX)) *(ry1-ry0)) /float(midY); // Limit the table read index in [0, mid] if C = 1 rid(x,mid, 0) = x; rid(x,mid, 1) = max(0, min(x, mid)); // Tabulate a binary 'FX' function on a range [rx0, rx1] [ry0, ry1] val(x,y) = rdtable(size, wf, readIndex); readIndex = rid( rid(int(idX+0.5),midX, C) +yOffset , mid, C); yOffset = sizeX*rid(int(idY),midY,C); // Tabulate a binary 'FX' function over the range [rx0, rx1] [ry0, ry1] with linear interpolation lin = it.interpolate_linear( dy , it.interpolate_linear(dx,v0,v1) , it.interpolate_linear(dx,v2,v3)) with { i0 = rid(int(idX), midX, C)+yOffset; i1 = i0+1; i2 = i0+sizeX; i3 = i1+sizeX; dx = idX-int(idX); dy = idY-int(idY); v0 = rdtable(size, wf, rid(i0, mid, C)); v1 = rdtable(size, wf, rid(i1, mid, C)); v2 = rdtable(size, wf, rid(i2, mid, C)); v3 = rdtable(size, wf, rid(i3, mid, C)); }; // Tabulate a binary 'FX' function over the range [rx0, rx1] [ry0, ry1] with cubic interpolation cub = it.interpolate_cubic( dy , it.interpolate_cubic(dx,v0,v1,v2,v3) , it.interpolate_cubic(dx,v4,v5,v6,v7) , it.interpolate_cubic(dx,v8,v9,v10,v11) , it.interpolate_cubic(dx,v12,v13,v14,v15) ) with { i0 = i4-sizeX; i1 = i5-sizeX; i2 = i6-sizeX; i3 = i7-sizeX; i4 = i5-1; i5 = rid(int(idX), midX, C)+yOffset; i6 = i5+1; i7 = i6+1; i8 = i4+sizeX; i9 = i5+sizeX; i10 = i6+sizeX; i11 = i7+sizeX; i12 = i4+(2*sizeX); i13 = i5+(2*sizeX); i14 = i6+(2*sizeX); i15 = i7+(2*sizeX); dx = idX-int(idX); dy = idY-int(idY); v0 = rdtable(size, wf, rid(i0 , mid, C)); v1 = rdtable(size, wf, rid(i1 , mid, C)); v2 = rdtable(size, wf, rid(i2 , mid, C)); v3 = rdtable(size, wf, rid(i3 , mid, C)); v4 = rdtable(size, wf, rid(i4 , mid, C)); v5 = rdtable(size, wf, rid(i5 , mid, C)); v6 = rdtable(size, wf, rid(i6 , mid, C)); v7 = rdtable(size, wf, rid(i7 , mid, C)); v8 = rdtable(size, wf, rid(i8 , mid, C)); v9 = rdtable(size, wf, rid(i9 , mid, C)); v10 = rdtable(size, wf, rid(i10, mid, C)); v11 = rdtable(size, wf, rid(i11, mid, C)); v12 = rdtable(size, wf, rid(i12, mid, C)); v13 = rdtable(size, wf, rid(i13, mid, C)); v14 = rdtable(size, wf, rid(i14, mid, C)); v15 = rdtable(size, wf, rid(i15, mid, C)); }; }; In the interest of brevity, we'll stop explaining here.

It contains three functions: start(x,y) to start a break-point function end(x,y) to end a break-point function point(x,y) to add intermediate points to a break-point function, using linear interpolation A minimal break-point function must contain at least a start and an end point: f = bpf.start(x0,y0) : bpf.end(x1,y1); A more involved break-point function can contains any number of intermediate points: f = bpf.start(x0,y0) : bpf.point(x1,y1) : bpf.point(x2,y2) : bpf.end(x3,y3); In any case the x_{i} must be in increasing order (for all i , x_{i} < x_{i+1} ). For example the following definition: f = bpf.start(x0,y0) : ... : bpf.point(xi,yi) : ... : bpf.end(xn,yn); implements a break-point function f such that: f(x) = y_{0} when x < x_{0} f(x) = y_{n} when x > x_{n} f(x) = y_{i} + (y_{i+1}-y_{i})*(x-x_{i})/(x_{i+1}-x_{i}) when x_{i} <= x and x < x_{i+1} In addition to bpf.point , there are also step and curve functions: step(x,y) to add a flat section step_end(x,y) to end with a flat section curve(B,x,y) to add a curved section curve_end(B,x,y) to end with a curved section These functions can be combined with the other bpf functions. Here's an example using bpf.step : f(x) = x : bpf.start(0,0) : bpf.step(.2,.3) : bpf.step(.4,.6) : bpf.step_end(1,1); For x < 0.0 , the output is 0.0. For 0.0 <= x < 0.2 , the output is 0.0. For 0.2 <= x < 0.4 , the output is 0.3. For 0.4 <= x < 1.0 , the output is 0.6. For 1.0 <= x , the output is 1.0 For the curve functions, B (compile-time constant) is a \"bias\" value strictly greater than zero and less than or equal to 1. When B is 0.5, the output curve is exactly linear and equivalent to bpf.point . When B is less than 0.5, the output is biased towards the y value of the previous breakpoint. When B is greater than 0.5, the output is biased towards the y value of the curve breakpoint. Here's an example: f = bpf.start(0,0) : bpf.curve(.15,.5,.5) : bpf.curve_end(.85,1,1); In the following example, the output is biased towards zero (the latter y value) instead of being a linear ramp from 1 to 0. f = bpf.start(0,1) : bpf.curve_end(.9,1,0); bpf is a standard Faust function.","title":"(ba.)bpf"},{"location":"libs/basics/#balistinterp","text":"Linearly interpolates between the elements of a list.","title":"(ba.)listInterp"},{"location":"libs/basics/#usage_63","text":"index = 1.69; // range is 0-4 process = listInterp((800,400,350,450,325),index); Where: index : the index (float) to interpolate between the different values.

Using the same trick for values 4 trough 7, we can write: efficientMax(x)= ( ( max(x@0,x@1), max(x@0,x@1)@2 ) :max ), ( ( max(x@0,x@1), max(x@0,x@1)@2 ) :max@4 ) :max; We can rewrite it recursively, so it becomes possible to get the maximum at have any number of values, as long as it's a power of 2. recursiveMax = case { (1,x) => x; (N,x) => max(recursiveMax(N/2,x), recursiveMax(N/2,x)@(N/2)); }; What if we want to look at a number of values that's not a power of 2? For each value, we will have to decide whether to use it or not. If n is bigger than the index of the value, we use it, otherwise we replace it with ( 0-(ma.MAX) ): variableMax(n,x) = max( max( ( (x@0 : useVal(0)), (x@1 : useVal(1)) ):max, ( (x@2 : useVal(2)), (x@3 : useVal(3)) ):max ), max( ( (x@4 : useVal(4)), (x@5 : useVal(5)) ):max, ( (x@6 : useVal(6)), (x@7 : useVal(7)) ):max ) ) with { useVal(i) = select2((n>=i) , (0-(ma.MAX)),_); }; Now it becomes impossible to re-use any values. To fix that let's first look at how we'd implement it using recursiveMax, but with a fixed n that is not a power of 2.

Its official prefix is co . References https://github.com/grame-cncm/faustlibraries/blob/master/compressors.lib Conversion Tools Most compressors have a ratio parameter to define the amount of compression. A ratio of 1 means no compression, a ratio of 2 means that for every dB the input goes above the threshold, the output gets turned down half a dB. To use a compressor as a brick wall limiter, the ratio needs to be infinity. This is hard to express in a Faust UI element, and overcompression can not be expressed at all, therefore most compressors in this library use a strength parameter instead, where 0 means no compression, 1 means hard limiting and bigger than 1 means over-compression. (co.)ratio2strength This utility converts a ratio to a strength. Usage ratio2strength(ratio) : _ Where: ratio : compression ratio, between 1 and infinity (1=no compression, infinity means hard limiting) (co.)strength2ratio This utility converts a strength to a ratio.

For that you'd need a ratio of infinity:1, and you cannot express that in Faust. Sometimes even bigger ratios are useful: for example a group recording where one instrument is recorded with both a close microphone and a room microphone, and the instrument is loud enough in the room mic when playing loud, but you want to boost it when it is playing soft.

This version of the limiter uses a peak-holder with smoothed attack and release based on tau time constant filters. It is also possible to use a time constant that is 2PI*tau by dividing the attack and release times by 2PI . This time constant allows for the amplitude profile to reach 1 - e^(-2PI) of the final peak after the attack time. The input path can be delayed by the same amount as the attack time to synchronise input and amplitude profile, realising a system that is particularly effective as a colourless (ideally) brickwall limiter. Note that the effectiveness of the ceiling settings are dependent on the other parameters, especially the time constant used for the smoothing filters and the lookahead delay. Similarly, the colourless characteristics are also dependent on attack, hold, and release times. Since fluctuations above ~15 Hz are perceived as timbral effects, [Vassilakis and Kendall 2010] it is reasonable to set the attack time to 1/15 seconds for a smooth amplitude modulation. On the other hand, the hold time can be set to the peak-to-peak period of the expected lowest frequency in the signal, which allows for minimal distortion of the low frequencies. The release time can then provide a perceptually linear and gradual gain increase determined by the user for any specific application. The scaling factor for all the channels is determined by the loudest peak between them all, so that amplitude ratios between the signals are kept.

This implementation, in particular, uses 2PI*tau time constant filters for attack and release smoothing with synchronised input and gain signals. This function's best application is to be used as a brickwall limiter with the least colouring artefacts while keeping a not-so-slow release curve. Tests have shown that, given a pop song with 60 dB of amplification and a 0-dB-ceiling, the loudest peak recorded was ~0.38 dB.

This version of the limiter uses a peak-holder with smoothed attack and release based on tau time constant filters. It is also possible to use a time constant that is 2PI*tau by dividing the attack and release times by 2PI . This time constant allows for the amplitude profile to reach 1 - e^(-2PI) of the final peak after the attack time. The input path can be delayed by the same amount as the attack time to synchronise input and amplitude profile, realising a system that is particularly effective as a colourless (ideally) brickwall limiter. Note that the effectiveness of the ceiling settings are dependent on the other parameters, especially the time constant used for the smoothing filters and the lookahead delay. Similarly, the colourless characteristics are also dependent on attack, hold, and release times. Since fluctuations above ~15 Hz are perceived as timbral effects, [Vassilakis and Kendall 2010] it is reasonable to set the attack time to 1/15 seconds for a smooth amplitude modulation.

Its official prefix is fd . In order to use the library, one needs to discretize the linear partial differential equation of the desired system both at boundaries and in-between them, thus obtaining a set of explicit recursion relations.

Coefficients need to be stacked in parallel in order to form a coefficients matrix for each point in the mesh. It is necessary to provide one matrix for coefficients matrices are defined, they need to be placed in parallel and ordered following the desired mesh structure (i.e., coefficients for the top left boundaries will come first, while bottom right boundaries will come last), to form a coefficients scheme , which can be used with the library functions.

They are related to the Mth-Octave Spectrum-Analyzers in analysis.lib . The documentation of this library contains more details about the implementation. The parameters are: M : number of band-slices per octave (>1), a constant numerical expression N : total number of bands (>2), a constant numerical expression ftop : upper bandlimit of the Mth-octave bands (<SR/2) In addition to the Mth-octave output signals, there is a highpass signal containing frequencies from ftop to SR/2, and a \"dc band\" lowpass signal containing frequencies from 0 (dc) up to the start of the Mth-octave bands. Thus, the N output signals are highpass(ftop), MthOctaveBands(M,N-2,ftop), dcBand(ftop*2^(-M*(N-1))) A Filter-Bank is defined here as a signal bandsplitter having the property that summing its output signals gives an allpass-filtered version of the filter-bank input signal. A more conventional term for this is an \"allpass-complementary filter bank\". If the allpass filter is a pure delay (and possible scaling), the filter bank is said to be a \"perfect-reconstruction filter bank\" (see Vaidyanathan-1993 cited below for details). A \"graphic equalizer\", in which band signals are scaled by gains and summed, should be based on a filter bank. The filter-banks below are implemented as Butterworth or Elliptic spectrum-analyzers followed by delay equalizers that make them allpass-complementary.

This filter uses both the lowpass and bandpass outputs of a state-variable filter. The lowpass is used to smooth out the input signal, the bandpass, which is a smoothed out version of the highpass, provides information on the rate of change of the input. Hence, the bandpass signal can be used to adjust the cutoff of the filter to quickly follow the input's fast and large variations while effectively filtering out local perturbations.

The 4th-order LR filters (LR4) have a 24dB/octave slope and they are rather popular audio crossovers used in multi-band processing. The LR4 can be constructed by cascading two second-order Butterworth filters. For the second-order Butterworth filters, we will use the SVF filter implemented above by setting the Q-factor to 1.0 / sqrt(2.0). These will be cascaded in pairs to build the LR4 highpass and lowpass. For the phase correction, we will use the 2nd-order Butterworth allpass.

One option for future improvement might be, to round those filter coefficients, that are almost equal to one. Second, the maximum magnitude difference at 48kHz between the ITU-defined filter and itu_r_bs_1770_4_kfilter is 0.001dB, which obviously could be less.

Usage _ : avg_rect(period) : _ Where: period is the averaging frame in seconds (fi.)avg_tau Averaging function based on a one-pole filter and the tau response time. Tau represents the effective length of the one-pole impulse response, that is, tau is the integral of the filter's impulse response. This response is slower to reach the final value but has less ripples in non-steady signals. Usage _ : avg_tau(period) : _ Where: period is the time, in seconds, for the system to decay by 1/e, or to reach 1-1/e of its final value. Reference https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/mdft/Exponentials.html (fi.)avg_t60 Averaging function based on a one-pole filter and the t60 response time. This response is particularly useful when the system is required to reach the final value after about period seconds. Usage _ : avg_t60(period) : _ Where: period is the time, in seconds, for the system to decay by 1/1000, or to reach 1-1/1000 of its final value. Reference https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/mdft/Audio_Decay_Time_T60.html (fi.)avg_t19 Averaging function based on a one-pole filter and the t19 response time. This response is close to the moving-average algorithm as it roughly reaches the final value after period seconds and shows about the same oscillations for non-steady signals. Usage _ : avg_t19(period) : _ Where: period is the time, in seconds, for the system to decay by 1/e^2.2, or to reach 1-1/e^2.2 of its final value. Reference Z\u00f6lzer, U. (2008). Digital audio signal processing (Vol. 9). New York: Wiley. Kalman Filters (fi.)kalman The Kalman filter. It returns the state (a bus of size N ).

Its official prefix is it . This library provides several basic interpolation functions, as well as interpolators taking a gen circuit of N outputs producing values to be interpolated, triggered by a idv read index signal. Two points and four points interpolations are implemented. The idv parameter is to be used as a read index. In -single (= singleprecision) mode, a technique based on 2 signals with the pure integer index and a fractional part in the [0,1] range is used to avoid accumulating errors. In -double (= doubleprecision) or -quad (= quadprecision) modes, a standard implementation with a single fractional index signal is used. Three functions int_part , frac_part and mak_idv are available to manipulate the read index signal. Here is a use-case with waveform .

References https://github.com/grame-cncm/faustlibraries/blob/master/mi.lib Utility Functions These utility functions are used to help certain operations (e.g. define initial positions and velocities for physical elements). (mi.)initState Used to set initial delayed position values that must be initialised at step 0 of the physics simulation. If you develop any of your own modules, you will need to use this (see mass and springDamper algorithm codes for examples). Usage x : initState(x0) : _ Where: x : position value signal x0 : initial value for position Mass Algorithms All mass-type physical element functions are declared here. They all expect to receive a force input signal and produce a position signal. All physical parameters are expressed in sample-rate dependant values. (mi.)mass Implementation of a punctual mass element. Takes an input force and produces output position. Usage mass(m, grav, x0, xr0),_ : _ Where: m : mass value grav : gravity force value x0 : initial position xr0 : initial delayed position (inferred from initial velocity) (mi.)oscil Implementation of a simple linear harmonic oscillator. Takes an input force and produces output position. Usage oscil(m, k, z, grav, x0, xr0),_ : _ Where: m : mass value k : stiffness value z : damping value grav : gravity force value x0 : initial position xr0 : initial delayed position (inferred from initial velocity) (mi.)ground Implementation of a fixed point element. The position output produced by this module never changes, however it still expects a force input signal (for compliance with connection rules). Usage ground(x0),_ : _ Where: x0 : initial position (mi.)posInput Implementation of a position input module (driven by an outside signal). Takes two signal inputs: incoming force (which doesn't affect position) and the driving position signal. Usage posInput(x0),_,_ : _ Where: x0 : initial position Interaction Algorithms All interaction-type physical element functions are declared here. They each expect to receive two position signals (coming from the two mass-elements that they connect) and produce two equal and opposite force signals that must be routed back to the mass elements' inputs. All physical parameters are expressed in sample-rate dependant values. (mi.)spring Implementation of a linear elastic spring interaction. Usage spring(k, x1r, x2r),_,_ : _,_ Where: k : stiffness value x1r : initial delayed position of mass 1 (unused here) x2r : initial delayed position of mass 2 (unused here) (mi.)damper Implementation of a linear damper interaction.

Usage bus(4*N) : mesh_square(N) : bus(4*N) Where: N : number of nodes along each edge - a power of two (1,2,4,8,...) Reference https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/pasp/Digital_Waveguide_Mesh.html Signal Order In and Out The mesh is constructed recursively using 2x2 embeddings. Thus, the top level of mesh_square(M) is a block 2x2 mesh, where each block is a mesh(M/2) . Let these blocks be numbered 1,2,3,4 in the geometry NW,NE,SW,SE, i.e., as: 1 2 3 4 Each block has four vector inputs and four vector outputs, where the length of each vector is M/2 . Label the input vectors as Ni,Ei,Wi,Si, i.e., as the inputs from the North, East South, and West, and similarly for the outputs. Then, for example, the upper left input block of M/2 signals is labeled 1Ni. Most of the connections are internal, such as 1Eo -> 2Wi. The 8*(M/2) input signals are grouped in the order: 1Ni 2Ni 3Si 4Si 1Wi 3Wi 2Ei 4Ei and the output signals are: 1No 1Wo 2No 2Eo 3So 3Wo 4So 4Eo or: In: 1No 1Wo 2No 2Eo 3So 3Wo 4So 4Eo Out: 1Ni 2Ni 3Si 4Si 1Wi 3Wi 2Ei 4Ei Thus, the inputs are grouped by direction N,S,W,E, while the outputs are grouped by block number 1,2,3,4, which can also be interpreted as directions NW, NE, SW, SE. A simple program illustrating these orderings is process = mesh_square(2); . Example Reflectively terminated mesh impulsed at one corner: mesh_square_test(N,x) = mesh_square(N)~(busi(4*N,x)) // input to corner with { busi(N,x) = bus(N) : par(i,N,*(-1)) : par(i,N-1,_), +(x); }; process = 1-1' : mesh_square_test(4); // all modes excited forever In this simple example, the mesh edges are connected as follows: 1No -> 1Ni, 1Wo -> 2Ni, 2No -> 3Si, 2Eo -> 4Si, 3So -> 1Wi, 3Wo -> 3Wi, 4So -> 2Ei, 4Eo -> 4Ei A routing matrix can be used to obtain other connection geometries.

The reason is that the incremental step is smaller than ma.EPSILON , which happens with very small frequencies, so it will have no effect when summed to 1, but it will be enough to make the fractional function wrap around when summed to 0. An example of this problem can be observed when running the following code: process = os.phasor(1.0, -.001); The output of this program is the sequence 1, 0, 1, 0, 1... This happens because the negative incremental step is greater than -ma.EPSILON , which will have no effect when summed to 1, but it will be significant enough to make the fractional function wrap around when summed to 0. The incremental step can be clipped to guarantee that the phasor will always run correctly for its full cycle, otherwise, for increments smaller than ma.EPSILON , phasor would initially run but it'd eventually get stuck once the output gets big enough. All functions using phasor_imp are affected by this problem, but a safer version is implemented, and can be used alternatively by setting SAFE=1 in the environment using explicit sustitution syntax. For example: process = os[SAFE=1;].phasor(1.0, -.001); will use the safer implementation of phasor_imp . Wave-Table-Based Oscillators Oscillators using tables.

The 'simple' versions ( lf_rawsaw , lf_sawpos and saw1 ), are mere samplings of the ideal continuous-time (\"analog\") waveforms. While simple, the aliasing due to sampling is quite audible. The differentiated polynomial waveform family ( saw2 , sawN , and derived functions) do some extra processing to suppress aliasing (not audible for very low fundamental frequencies). According to Lehtonen et al. (JASA 2012), the aliasing of saw2 should be inaudible at fundamental frequencies below 2 kHz or so, for a 44.1 kHz sampling rate and 60 dB SPL presentation level; fundamentals 415 and below required no aliasing suppression (i.e., saw1 is ok).

Usage sawNp(N,freq,phase) : _ where N : waveform interpolation polynomial order 1 to 4 (constant integer expression) freq : frequency in Hz phase : waveform phase as a fraction of one period (rounded to nearest sample) Implementation Notes The phase offset is implemented by delaying sawN(N,freq) by round(phase*ma.SR/freq) samples, for up to 8191 samples. The minimum sawtooth frequency that can be delayed a whole period is therefore ma.SR/8191 , which is well below audibility for normal audio sampling rates.

Usage saw2f2(freq) : _ saw2f4(freq) : _ with freq : frequency in Hz In return for aliasing suppression, there is some attenuation near half the sampling rate. This can be considered as beneficial, or it can be compensated with a high-frequency boost. The boost filter is second-order for saw2f2 and fourth-order for saw2f4 , and both are designed for the DWP case and therefore use saw2dpw .

Implementation Notes This is based on the trivial trigonometric identities: cos((n + 1) x) = 2 cos(x) cos(n x) - cos((n - 1) x) sin((n + 1) x) = 2 cos(x) sin(n x) - sin((n - 1) x) Note that the calculation of the cosine/sine parts do not depend on each other, so if you only need the sine part you can do: process = os.quadosc(F) : sidebands(vs) : !,_; and the compiler will discard the half of the calculations.

The reason is that the incremental step is smaller than ma.EPSILON , which happens with very small frequencies, so it will have no effect when summed to 1, but it will be enough to make the fractional function wrap around when summed to 0. An example of this problem can be observed when running the following code: process = os.phasor(1.0, -.001); The output of this program is the sequence 1, 0, 1, 0, 1... This happens because the negative incremental step is greater than -ma.EPSILON , which will have no effect when summed to 1, but it will be significant enough to make the fractional function wrap around when summed to 0. The incremental step can be clipped to guarantee that the phasor will always run correctly for its full cycle, otherwise, for increments smaller than ma.EPSILON , phasor would initially run but it'd eventually get stuck once the output gets big enough. All functions using phasor_imp are affected by this problem, but a safer version is implemented, and can be used alternatively by setting SAFE=1 in the environment using explicit sustitution syntax. For example: process = os[SAFE=1;].phasor(1.0, -.001); will use the safer implementation of phasor_imp .","title":"Oscillators based on mathematical functions"},{"location":"libs/oscillators/#wave-table-based-oscillators","text":"Oscillators using tables.

Its official prefix is pm . This library provides an environment to facilitate physical modeling of musical instruments. It contains dozens of functions implementing low and high level elements going from a simple waveguide to fully operational models with built-in UI, etc. It is organized as follows: Global Variables : useful pre-defined variables for physical modeling (e.g., speed of sound, etc.). Conversion Tools : conversion functions specific to physical modeling (e.g., length to frequency, etc.). Bidirectional Utilities : functions to create bidirectional block diagrams for physical modeling. Basic Elements : waveguides, specific types of filters, etc. String Instruments : various types of strings (e.g., steel, nylon, etc.), bridges, guitars, etc. Bowed String Instruments : parts and models specific to bowed string instruments (e.g., bows, bridges, violins, etc.). Wind Instrument : parts and models specific to wind instruments (e.g., reeds, mouthpieces, flutes, clarinets, etc.). Exciters : pluck generators, \"blowers\", etc. Modal Percussions : percussion instruments based on modal models. Vocal Synthesis : functions for various vocal synthesis techniques (e.g., fof, source/filter, etc.) and vocal synthesizers. Misc Functions : any other functions that don't fit in the previous category (e.g., nonlinear filters, etc.). This library is part of the Faust Physical Modeling ToolKit. More information on how to use this library can be found on this page or this video . Tutorials on how to make physical models of musical instruments using Faust can be found here as well. References https://github.com/grame-cncm/faustlibraries/blob/master/physmodels.lib Global Variables Useful pre-defined variables for physical modeling. (pm.)speedOfSound Speed of sound in meters per second (340m/s). (pm.)maxLength The default maximum length (3) in meters of strings and tubes used in this library. This variable should be overriden to allow longer strings or tubes. Conversion Tools Useful conversion tools for physical modeling. (pm.)f2l Frequency to length in meters. Usage f2l(freq) : distanceInMeters Where: freq : the frequency (pm.)l2f Length in meters to frequency. Usage l2f(length) : freq Where: length : length/distance in meters (pm.)l2s Length in meters to number of samples. Usage l2s(l) : numberOfSamples Where: l : length in meters Bidirectional Utilities Set of fundamental functions to create bi-directional block diagrams in Faust. These elements are used as the basis of this library to connect high level elements (e.g., mouthpieces, strings, bridge, instrument body, etc.). Each block has 3 inputs and 3 outputs. The first input/output carry left going waves, the second input/output carry right going waves, and the third input/output is used to carry any potential output signal to the end of the algorithm. (pm.)basicBlock Empty bidirectional block to be used with chain : 3 signals ins and 3 signals out. Usage chain(basicBlock : basicBlock : etc.) (pm.)chain Creates a chain of bidirectional blocks. Blocks must have 3 inputs and outputs. The first input/output carry left going waves, the second input/output carry right going waves, and the third input/output is used to carry any potential output signal to the end of the algorithm. The implied one sample delay created by the ~ operator is generalized to the left and right going waves. Thus, n blocks in chain() will add an n samples delay to both left and right going waves.

Designed to sound great with synthetic sound sources, rather than sound like a realistic space. Usage _,_ : jpverb(t60, damp, size, early_diff, mod_depth, mod_freq, low, mid, high, low_cutoff, high_cutoff) : _,_ Where: t60 : approximate reverberation time in seconds ([0.1..60] sec) (T60 - the time for the reverb to decay by 60db when damp == 0 ). Does not effect early reflections damp : controls damping of high-frequencies as the reverb decays. 0 is no damping, 1 is very strong damping. Values should be in the range ([0..1]) size : scales size of delay-lines within the reverberator, producing the impression of a larger or smaller space. Values below 1 can sound metallic. Values should be in the range [0.5..5] early_diff : controls shape of early reflections. Values of 0.707 or more produce smooth exponential decay. Lower values produce a slower build-up of echoes. Values should be in the range ([0..1]) mod_depth : depth ([0..1]) of delay-line modulation. Use in combination with mod_freq to set amount of chorusing within the structure mod_freq : frequency ([0..10] Hz) of delay-line modulation. Use in combination with mod_depth to set amount of chorusing within the structure low : multiplier ([0..1]) for the reverberation time within the low band mid : multiplier ([0..1]) for the reverberation time within the mid band high : multiplier ([0..1]) for the reverberation time within the high band low_cutoff : frequency (100..6000 Hz) at which the crossover between the low and mid bands of the reverb occurs high_cutoff : frequency (1000..10000 Hz) at which the crossover between the mid and high bands of the reverb occurs Reference https://doc.sccode.org/Overviews/DEIND.html (re.)greyhole A complex echo-like effect (stereo in/out), inspired by the classic Eventide effect of a similar name. The effect consists of a diffuser (like a mini-reverb, structurally similar to the one used in jpverb ) connected in a feedback system with a long, modulated delay-line. Excels at producing spacey washes of sound. Usage _,_ : greyhole(dt, damp, size, early_diff, feedback, mod_depth, mod_freq) : _,_ Where: dt : approximate reverberation time in seconds ([0.1..60 sec]) damp : controls damping of high-frequencies as the reverb decays. 0 is no damping, 1 is very strong damping. Values should be between ([0..1]) size : control of relative \"room size\" roughly in the range ([0.5..3]) early_diff : controls pattern of echoes produced by the diffuser. At very low values, the diffuser acts like a delay-line whose length is controlled by the 'size' parameter. Medium values produce a slow build-up of echoes, giving the sound a reversed-like quality. Values of 0.707 or greater than produce smooth exponentially decaying echoes. Values should be in the range ([0..1]) feedback : amount of feedback through the system. Sets the number of repeating echoes. A setting of 1.0 produces infinite sustain. Values should be in the range ([0..1]) mod_depth : depth ([0..1]) of delay-line modulation. Use in combination with mod_freq to produce chorus and pitch-variations in the echoes mod_freq : frequency ([0..10] Hz) of delay-line modulation. Use in combination with mod_depth to produce chorus and pitch-variations in the echoes Reference https://doc.sccode.org/Overviews/DEIND.html Keith Barr Allpass Loop Reverb (re.)kb_rom_rev1 Reverberator based on Keith Barr's all-pass single feedback loop reverb topology. Originally designed for the Spin Semiconductor FV-1 chip, this code is an adaptation of the rom_rev1.spn file, part of the Spin Semiconductor Free DSP Programs available on the Spin Semiconductor website. It was submitted by Keith Barr himself and written in Spin Semiconductor Assembly, a dedicated assembly language for programming the FV-1 chip. In this topology, when multiple delays and all-pass filters are placed in a loop, sound injected into the loop will recirculate, increasing the density of any impulse as the signal successively passes through the all-pass filters. The result, after a short period of time, is a wash of sound, completely diffused into a natural reverb tail. The reverb typically has a mono input (as from a single source) but benefits from a stereo output, providing the listener with a fuller, more immersive reverberant image.

Usage _ : rev(n) : _ Where: n : the block size in samples (si.)vecOp This function is a generalisation of Faust's iterators such as prod and sum , and it allows to perform operations on an arbitrary number of vectors, provided that they all have the same length. Unlike Faust's iterators prod and sum where the vector size is equal to one and the vector space dimension must be specified by the user, this function will infer the vector space dimension and vector size based on the vectors list that we provide. The outputs of the function are equal to the vector size, whereas the number of inputs is dependent on whether the elements of the vectors provided expect an incoming signal themselves or not. We will see a clarifying example later; in general, the number of total inputs will be the sum of the inputs in each input vector. Note that we must provide a list of at least two vectors, each with a size that is greater or equal to one. Usage si.bus(inputs(vectorsList)) : vecOp((vectorsList), op) : si.bus(outputs(ba.take(1, vectorsList))); Where vectorsList : is a list of vectors op : is a two-input, one-output operator For example, consider the following vectors lists: v0 = (0 , 1 , 2 , 3); v1 = (4 , 5 , 6 , 7); v2 = (8 , 9 , 10 , 11); v3 = (12 , 13 , 14 , 15); v4 = (+(16) , _ , 18 , *(19)); vv = (v0 , v1 , v2 , v3); Although Faust has limitations for list processing, these vectors can be combined or processed individually. If we do: process = vecOp(v0, +); the function will deduce a vector space of dimension equal to four and a vector length equal to one. Note that this is equivalent to writing: process = v0 : sum(i, 4, _); Similarly, we can write: process = vecOp((v0 , v1), *) :> _; and we have a dimension-two space and length-four vectors. This is the dot product between vectors v0 and v1, which is equivalent to writing: process = v0 , v1 : dot(4); The examples above have no inputs, as none of the elements of the vectors expect inputs. On the other hand, we can write: process = vecOp((v4 , v4), +); and the function will have six inputs and four outputs, as each vector has three of the four elements expecting an input, times two, as the two input vectors are identical. Finally, we can write: process = vecOp(vv, &); to perform the bitwise AND on all the elements at the same position in each vector, having dimension equal to the vector length equal to four. Or even: process = vecOp((vv , vv), &); which gives us a dimension equal to two, and a vector size equal to sixteen. For a more practical use-case, this is how we can implement a time-invariant feedback delay network with Hadamard matrix: N = 4; normalisation = 1.0 / sqrt(N); coeffVec = par(i, N, .99 * normalisation); delVec = par(i, N, (i + 1) * 3); process = vecOp((si.bus(N) , si.bus(N)), +) ~ vecOp((vecOp((ro.hadamard(N) , coeffVec), *) , delVec), @); (si.)bpar Balanced par where the repeated expression doesn't depend on a variable. The built-in par is implemented as an unbalanced tree, and also has to substitute the variable into the repeated expression, which is expensive even when the variable doesn't appear. This version is implemented as a balanced tree (which allows node reuse during tree traversal) and also doesn't search for the variable. This can be much faster than par to compile.

It is based on the block diagram in Figure 7.5. The Oberheim filter is a state-variable filter with soft-clipping distortion within the circuit. In many VA filters, distortion is accomplished using the \"tanh\" function. For this Faust implementation, that distortion function was replaced with the (ef.)cubicnl function.

Usage _ : oberheimLPF(normFreq,Q) : _ Where: normFreq : normalized frequency (0-1) Q : q Sallen Key Filters The following filters were implemented based on VA models of synthesizer filters. The modeling approach is based on a Topology Preserving Transform (TPT) to resolve the delay-free feedback loop in the corresponding analog filters. The primary processing block used to build other filters (Moog, Korg, etc.) is based on a 1st-order Sallen-Key filter. The filters included in this script are 1st-order LPF/HPF and 2nd-order state-variable filters capable of LPF, HPF, and BPF. Resources: Vadim Zavalishin (2018) \"The Art of VA Filter Design\", v2.1.0 https://www.native-instruments.com/fileadmin/ni_media/downloads/pdf/VAFilterDesign_2.1.0.pdf Will Pirkle (2014) \"Resolving Delay-Free Loops in Recursive Filters Using the Modified H\u00e4rm\u00e4 Method\", AES 137 http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=17517 Description and diagrams of 1st- and 2nd-order TPT filters: https://www.willpirkle.com/706-2/ (ve.)sallenKeyOnePole Sallen-Key generic One Pole filter that produces the LPF and HPF outputs (see description above). For the Faust implementation of this filter, recursion ( letrec ) is used for storing filter \"states\". The output (e.g. y ) is calculated by using the input signal and the previous states of the filter. During the current recursive step, the states of the filter (e.g. s ) for the next step are also calculated. Admittedly, this is not an efficient way to implement a filter because it requires independently calculating the output and each state during each recursive step. However, it works as a way to store and use \"states\" within the constraints of Faust. The simplest example is the 1st-order LPF (shown on the cover of Zavalishin * 2018 and Fig 4.3 of https://www.willpirkle.com/706-2/ ). Here, the input signal is split in parallel for the calculation of the output signal, y , and the state s . The value of the state is only used for feedback to the next step of recursion. It is blocked (!) from also being routed to the output. A trick used for calculating the state s is to observe that the input to the delay block is the sum of two signal: what appears to be a feedforward path and a feedback path. In reality, the signals being summed are identical (signal*2) plus the value of the current state. Usage _ : sallenKeyOnePole(normFreq) : _,_ Where: normFreq : normalized frequency (0-1) (ve.)sallenKeyOnePoleLPF Sallen-Key One Pole lowpass filter (see description above). Specialize the generic implementation: keep the first LPF output, the compiler will only generate the needed code. Usage _ : sallenKeyOnePoleLPF(normFreq) : _ Where: normFreq : normalized frequency (0-1) (ve.)sallenKeyOnePoleHPF Sallen-Key One Pole Highpass filter (see description above). The dry input signal is routed in parallel to the output. The LPF'd signal is subtracted from the input so that the HPF remains. Specialize the generic implementation: keep the second HPF output, the compiler will only generate the needed code. Usage _ : sallenKeyOnePoleHPF(normFreq) : _ Where: normFreq : normalized frequency (0-1) (ve.)sallenKey2ndOrder Sallen-Key generic 2nd order filter that produces the LPF, BPF and HPF outputs. This is a 2nd-order Sallen-Key state-variable filter. The idea is that by \"tapping\" into different points in the circuit, different filters (LPF,BPF,HPF) can be achieved. See Figure 4.6 of * https://www.willpirkle.com/706-2/ This is also a good example of the next step for generalizing the Faust programming approach used for all these VA filters. In this case, there are three things to calculate each recursive step ( y , s1 , s2 ). For each thing, the circuit is only calculated up to that point. Comparing the LPF to BPF, the output signal ( y ) is calculated similarly. Except, the output of the BPF stops earlier in the circuit. Similarly, the states ( s1 and s2 ) only differ in that s2 includes a couple more terms beyond what is used for s1 .

This collection implements high-quality, double-precision second-order filters based on the work of Vicanek, offering improved frequency accuracy and dynamic response over traditional biquads\u2014especially near Nyquist. Standard digital filter designs (like bilinear-transformed biquads) suffer from frequency warping, which distorts the placement of poles and zeros. Vicanek's method, detailed in his paper \"Matched Second Order Digital Filters\" , proposes a set of matched filter formulas that eliminate such warping, preserving the intended analog-like behavior and frequency response.

Its official prefix is wd . Library Readme This library is intended for use for creating Wave Digital (WD) based models of audio circuitry for real-time audio processing within the Faust programming language. The goal is to provide a framework to create real-time virtual-analog audio effects and synthesizers using WD models without the use of C++. Furthermore, we seek to provide access to the technique of WD modeling to those without extensive knowledge of advanced digital signal processing techniques. Finally, we hope to provide a library which can integrate with all aspects of Faust, thus creating a platform for virtual circuit bending. The library itself is written in Faust to maintain portability. This library is heavily based on Kurt Werner's Dissertation, \"Virtual Analog Modeling of Audio Circuitry Using Wave Digital Filters.\" I have tried to maintain consistent notation between the adaptors appearing within thesis and my adaptor code. The majority of the adaptors found in chapter 1 and chapter 3 are currently supported. For inquires about use of this library in a commercial product, please contact dirk [dot] roosenburg [dot] 30 [at] gmail [dot] com. This documentation is taken directly from the readme . Please refer to it for a more updated version. Many of the more in depth comments within the library include jargon. I plan to create videos detailing the theory of WD models. For now I recommend Kurt Werner's PhD, Virtual analog modeling of Audio circuitry using Wave Digital Filters . I have tried to maintain consistent syntax and notation to the thesis. This library currently includes the majority of the adaptors covered in chapter 1 and some from chapter 3. Using this Library Use of this library expects some level of familiarity with WDF techniques, especially simplification and decomposition of electronic circuits into WDF connection trees. I plan to create video to cover both these techniques and use of the library. Quick Start To get a quick overview of the library, start with the secondOrderFilters.dsp code found in examples . Note that the wdmodels.lib library is now embedded in the online Faust IDE . A Simple RC Filter Model Creating a model using this library consists fo three steps. First, declare a set of components. Second, model the relationship between them using a tree. Finally, build the tree using the libraries build functions. First, a set of components is declared using adaptors from the library. This list of components is created based on analysis of the circuit using WDF techniques, though generally each circuit element (resistor, capacitor, diode, etc.) can be expected to appear within the component set. For example, first order RC lowpass filter would require an unadapted voltage source, a 47k resistor, and a 10nF capacitor which outputs the voltage across itself. These can be declared with: vs1(i) = wd.u_voltage(i, no.noise); r1(i) = wd.resistor(i, 47*10^3); c1(i) = wd.capacitor_Vout(i, 10*10^-9); Note that the first argument, i, is left un-parametrized. Components must be declared in this form, as the build algorithm expects to receive adaptors which have exactly one parameter. Also note that we have chosen to declare a white noise function as the input to our voltage source. We could potentially declare this as a direct input to our model, but to do so is more complicated process which cannot be covered within this tutorial. For information on how to do this see Declaring Model Parameters as Inputs or see various implementations in examples . Second, the declared components and interconnection/structural adaptors (i.e. series, parallel, etc) are arranged into the connection tree which is produced from performing WD analysis on the modeled circuit. For example, to produce our first order RC lowpass circuit model, the following tree is declared: tree_lowpass = vs1 : wd.series : (r1, c1); For more information on how to represent trees in Faust, see Trees in Faust . Finally, the tree is built using the the buildtree function. To build and compute our first order RC lowpass circuit model, we use: process = wd.buildtree(tree_lowpass); More information about build functions, see Model Building Functions . Building a Model After creating a connection tree which consists of WD adaptors, the connection tree must be passed to a build function in order to build the model. Automatic model building buildtree(connection_tree) The simplest build function for use with basic models. This automatically implements buildup , builddown , and buildout to create a working model. However, it gives minimum control to the user and cannot currently be used on trees which have parameters declared as inputs. Manual model building Wave Digital Filters are an explicit state-space model, meaning they use a previous system state in order to calculate the current output. This is achieved in Faust by using a single global feedback operator. The models feed-forward terms are generated using builddown and the models feedback terms are generated using buildup . Thus, the most common model implementation (the method used by buildtree ) is: builddown(connection_tree)~buildup(connection_tree) : buildout(connection_tree) Since the ~ operator in Faust will leave feedback terms hanging as outputs, buildout is a function provided for convenience. It automatically truncates the hanging outputs by identifying leaf components which have an intended output and generating an output matrix. Building the model manually allows for greater user control and is often very helpful in testing. Also provided for testing are the getres and parres functions, which can be used to determine the upward-facing port resistance of an element. Declaring Model Parameters as Inputs When possible, parameters of components should be declared explicitly, meaning they are dependent on a function with no inputs. This might be something as simple as integer(declaring a static component), a function dependent on a UI input (declaring a component with variable value), or even a time-dependent function like an oscillator (declaring an audio input or circuit bending). However, it is often necessary to declare parameters as input. To achieve this there are two possible methods. The first and recommended option is to create a separate model function and declare parameters which will later be implemented as inputs. This allows inputs to be explicitly declared as component parameters. For example, one might use: model(in1) = buildtree(tree) with { ... vin(i) = wd.u_voltage(i, in1); ... tree = vin : ...; }; In order to simulate an audio input to the circuit. Note that the tree and components must be declared inside a with {...} statement, or the model's parameters will not be accessible. The Empty Signal Operator The Empty signal operator, _ should NEVER be used to declare a parameter as in input in a wave-digital model. Using it will result on breaking the internal routing of the model and thus breaks the model. Instead, use explicit declaration as shown directly above. Trees in Faust Since WD models use connection trees to represent relationships of elements, a comprehensive way to represent trees is critical. As there is no current convention for creating trees in Faust, I've developed a method using the existing series and parallel/list methods in Faust. The series operator : is used to separate parent and child elements. For example the tree: A | B is represented by A : B in Faust. To denote a parent element with multiple child elements, simply use a list (a1, a2, ... an) of children connected to a single parent. ` For example the tree: A / \\ B C is represented by: A : (B, C) Finally, for a tree with many levels, simply break the tree into subtrees following the above rules and connect the subtree as if it was an individual node. For example the tree: A / \\ B C / / \\ X Y Z can be represented by: B_sub = B : X; //B subtree C_sub = C : (Y, Z); //C subtree tree = A : (B_sub, C_sub); //full tree or more simply, using parentheses: A : ((B : X), (C : (Y, Z))) How Adaptors are Structured In wave digital filters, adaptors can be described by the form b = Sa where b is a vector of output waves b = (b0, b1, b2, ... bn) , a is a vector of input waves a = (a0, a1, a2, ... an) , and S is an n x n scattering matrix. S is dependent on R , a list of port resistances (R0, R1, R2, ... Rn) . The output wave vector b can be divided into downward-going and upward-going waves (downward-going waves travel down the connection tree, upward-going waves travel up). For adapted adaptors, with the zeroth port being the upward-facing port, the downward-going wave vector is (b1, b2, ... bn) and the upward-going wave vector is (b0) . For unadapted adaptors, there are no upward-going waves, so the downward-going wave vector is simply b = (b0, b1, b2, ... bn) . In order for adaptors to be interpretable by the compiler, they must be structured in a specific way. Each adaptor is divided into three cases by their first parameter. This parameter, while accessible by the user, should only be set by the compiler/builder. All other parameters are value declarations (for components), inputs (for voltage or current ins), or parameter controls (for potentiometers/variable capacitors/variable inductors). First case - downward going waves (0, params) => downward-going(R1, ... Rn, a0, a1, ... an) outputs: (b1, b2, ... bn) this function takes any number of port resistances, the downward going wave, and any number of upward going waves as inputs. These values/waves are used to calculate the downward going waves coming from this adaptor. Second case (1, params) => upward-going(R1, ... Rn, a1, ... an) outputs : (b0) this function takes any number of port resistances and any number of upward going waves as inputs. These values/waves are used to calculate the upward going wave coming from this adaptor. Third case (2, params) => port-resistance(R1, ... Rn) outputs: (R0) this function takes any number of port resistances as inputs. These values are used to calculate the upward going port resistance of the element. Unadapted Adaptors Unadapted adaptor's names will always begin u_ An unadapted adaptor MUST be used as the root of the WD connection tree. Unadapted adaptors can ONLY be used as a root of the WD connection tree. While unadapted adaptors contain all three cases, the second and third are purely structural. Only the first case should contain computational information. How the Build Functions Work Expect this section to be added soon! It's currently in progress.

Finally, we hope to provide a library which can integrate with all aspects of Faust, thus creating a platform for virtual circuit bending. The library itself is written in Faust to maintain portability.

First, declare a set of components. Second, model the relationship between them using a tree. Finally, build the tree using the libraries build functions. First, a set of components is declared using adaptors from the library. This list of components is created based on analysis of the circuit using WDF techniques, though generally each circuit element (resistor, capacitor, diode, etc.) can be expected to appear within the component set. For example, first order RC lowpass filter would require an unadapted voltage source, a 47k resistor, and a 10nF capacitor which outputs the voltage across itself. These can be declared with: vs1(i) = wd.u_voltage(i, no.noise); r1(i) = wd.resistor(i, 47*10^3); c1(i) = wd.capacitor_Vout(i, 10*10^-9); Note that the first argument, i, is left un-parametrized. Components must be declared in this form, as the build algorithm expects to receive adaptors which have exactly one parameter. Also note that we have chosen to declare a white noise function as the input to our voltage source. We could potentially declare this as a direct input to our model, but to do so is more complicated process which cannot be covered within this tutorial.

Second, the declared components and interconnection/structural adaptors (i.e. series, parallel, etc) are arranged into the connection tree which is produced from performing WD analysis on the modeled circuit. For example, to produce our first order RC lowpass circuit model, the following tree is declared: tree_lowpass = vs1 : wd.series : (r1, c1); For more information on how to represent trees in Faust, see Trees in Faust . Finally, the tree is built using the the buildtree function. To build and compute our first order RC lowpass circuit model, we use: process = wd.buildtree(tree_lowpass); More information about build functions, see Model Building Functions .","title":"A Simple RC Filter Model"},{"location":"libs/wdmodels/#building-a-model","text":"After creating a connection tree which consists of WD adaptors, the connection tree must be passed to a build function in order to build the model.","title":"Building a Model"},{"location":"libs/wdmodels/#automatic-model-building","text":"buildtree(connection_tree) The simplest build function for use with basic models.

This is achieved in Faust by using a single global feedback operator. The models feed-forward terms are generated using builddown and the models feedback terms are generated using buildup . Thus, the most common model implementation (the method used by buildtree ) is: builddown(connection_tree)~buildup(connection_tree) : buildout(connection_tree) Since the ~ operator in Faust will leave feedback terms hanging as outputs, buildout is a function provided for convenience. It automatically truncates the hanging outputs by identifying leaf components which have an intended output and generating an output matrix. Building the model manually allows for greater user control and is often very helpful in testing. Also provided for testing are the getres and parres functions, which can be used to determine the upward-facing port resistance of an element.","title":"Manual model building"},{"location":"libs/wdmodels/#declaring-model-parameters-as-inputs","text":"When possible, parameters of components should be declared explicitly, meaning they are dependent on a function with no inputs. This might be something as simple as integer(declaring a static component), a function dependent on a UI input (declaring a component with variable value), or even a time-dependent function like an oscillator (declaring an audio input or circuit bending). However, it is often necessary to declare parameters as input. To achieve this there are two possible methods. The first and recommended option is to create a separate model function and declare parameters which will later be implemented as inputs. This allows inputs to be explicitly declared as component parameters. For example, one might use: model(in1) = buildtree(tree) with { ... vin(i) = wd.u_voltage(i, in1); ... tree = vin : ...; }; In order to simulate an audio input to the circuit. Note that the tree and components must be declared inside a with {...} statement, or the model's parameters will not be accessible.","title":"Declaring Model Parameters as Inputs"},{"location":"libs/wdmodels/#the-empty-signal-operator","text":"The Empty signal operator, _ should NEVER be used to declare a parameter as in input in a wave-digital model.

As there is no current convention for creating trees in Faust, I've developed a method using the existing series and parallel/list methods in Faust. The series operator : is used to separate parent and child elements. For example the tree: A | B is represented by A : B in Faust. To denote a parent element with multiple child elements, simply use a list (a1, a2, ... an) of children connected to a single parent. ` For example the tree: A / \\ B C is represented by: A : (B, C) Finally, for a tree with many levels, simply break the tree into subtrees following the above rules and connect the subtree as if it was an individual node. For example the tree: A / \\ B C / / \\ X Y Z can be represented by: B_sub = B : X; //B subtree C_sub = C : (Y, Z); //C subtree tree = A : (B_sub, C_sub); //full tree or more simply, using parentheses: A : ((B : X), (C : (Y, Z)))","title":"Trees in Faust"},{"location":"libs/wdmodels/#how-adaptors-are-structured","text":"In wave digital filters, adaptors can be described by the form b = Sa where b is a vector of output waves b = (b0, b1, b2, ... bn) , a is a vector of input waves a = (a0, a1, a2, ... an) , and S is an n x n scattering matrix. S is dependent on R , a list of port resistances (R0, R1, R2, ... Rn) . The output wave vector b can be divided into downward-going and upward-going waves (downward-going waves travel down the connection tree, upward-going waves travel up). For adapted adaptors, with the zeroth port being the upward-facing port, the downward-going wave vector is (b1, b2, ... bn) and the upward-going wave vector is (b0) . For unadapted adaptors, there are no upward-going waves, so the downward-going wave vector is simply b = (b0, b1, b2, ... bn) . In order for adaptors to be interpretable by the compiler, they must be structured in a specific way. Each adaptor is divided into three cases by their first parameter. This parameter, while accessible by the user, should only be set by the compiler/builder.
