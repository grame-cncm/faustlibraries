The parameters are: M : number of band-slices per octave (>1) N : total number of bands (>2) ftop = upper bandlimit of the Mth-octave bands (<SR/2) In addition to the Mth-octave output signals, there is a highpass signal containing frequencies from ftop to SR/2, and a \"dc band\" lowpass signal containing frequencies from 0 (dc) up to the start of the Mth-octave bands. Thus, the N output signals are highpass(ftop), MthOctaveBands(M,N-2,ftop), dcBand(ftop*2^(-M*(N-1))) A Spectrum-Analyzer is defined here as any band-split whose bands span the relevant spectrum, but whose band-signals do not necessarily sum to the original signal, either exactly or to within an allpass filtering. Spectrum analyzer outputs are normally at least nearly \"power complementary\", i.e., the power spectra of the individual bands sum to the original power spectrum (to within some negligible tolerance).

Using the same trick for values 4 trough 7, we can write: efficientMax(x)= ( ( max(x@0,x@1), max(x@0,x@1)@2 ) :max ), ( ( max(x@0,x@1), max(x@0,x@1)@2 ) :max@4 ) :max; We can rewrite it recursively, so it becomes possible to get the maximum at have any number of values, as long as it's a power of 2. recursiveMax = case { (1,x) => x; (N,x) => max(recursiveMax(N/2,x) , recursiveMax(N/2,x)@(N/2)); }; What if we want to look at a number of values that's not a power of 2? For each value, we will have to decide whether to use it or not. If N is bigger than the index of the value, we use it, otherwise we replace it with ( 0-(ma.INFINITY) ): variableMax(N,x) = max( max( ( (x@0 : useVal(0)), (x@1 : useVal(1)) ):max, ( (x@2 : useVal(2)), (x@3 : useVal(3)) ):max ), max( ( (x@4 : useVal(4)), (x@5 : useVal(5)) ):max, ( (x@6 : useVal(6)), (x@7 : useVal(7)) ):max ) ) with { useVal(i) = select2((N>=i) , (0-(ma.INFINITY)),_); }; Now it becomes impossible to re-use any values. To fix that let's first look at how we'd implement it using recursiveMax, but with a fixed N that is not a power of 2. For example, this is how you'd do it with N=3 : binaryMaxThree(x) = ( recursiveMax(1,x)@0, the first x recursiveMax(2,x)@1 the second and third x ):max; N=6 binaryMaxSix(x) = ( recursiveMax(2,x)@0, first two recursiveMax(4,x)@2 third trough sixth ):max; Note that recursiveMax(2,x) is used at a different delay then in binaryMaxThree , since it represents 1 and 2, not 2 and 3. Each block is delayed the combined size of the previous blocks. N=7 binaryMaxSeven(x) = ( ( recursiveMax(1,x)@0, first x recursiveMax(2,x)@1 second and third ):max, ( recursiveMax(4,x)@3 fourth trough seventh ) ):max; To make a variable version, we need to know which powers of two are used, and at which delay time. Then it becomes a matter of: lining up all the different block sizes in parallel: the first par() statement delaying each the appropriate amount: sumOfPrevBlockSizes() turning it on or off: useVal() getting the maximum of all of them: combine() In Faust, we can only do that for a fixed maximum number of values: maxN variableBinaryMaxN(N,maxN,x) = par(i,maxNrBits,recursiveMax(pow2(i),x)@sumOfPrevBlockSizes(N,maxN,i) : useVal(i)) : combine(maxNrBits) with { The sum of all the sizes of the previous blocks sumOfPrevBlockSizes(N,maxN,0) = 0; sumOfPrevBlockSizes(N,maxN,i) = (subseq((allBlockSizes(N,maxN)),0,i):>_); allBlockSizes(N,maxN) = par(i, maxNrBits, pow2(i) * isUsed(i) ); maxNrBits = int2nrOfBits(maxN); get the maximum of all blocks combine(2) = max; combine(N) = max(combine(N-1),_); Decide wether or not to use a certain value, based on N useVal(i) = select2( isUsed(i), (0-(ma.INFINITY)),_); isUsed(i) = take(i+1,(int2bin(N,maxN))); }; (ba.)slidingReduce Fold-like high order function. Apply a commutative binary operation <op> to the last <n> consecutive samples of a signal <x> . For example : slidingReduce(max,128,128,-(ma.INFINITY)) will compute the maximum of the last 128 samples. The output is updated each sample, unlike reduce, where the output is constant for the duration of a block. Usage _ : slidingReduce(op,N,maxN,disabledVal) : _ Where: N : the number of values to process maxN : the maximum number of values to process, needs to be a power of 2 op : the operator. Needs to be a commutative one. disabledVal : the value to use when we want to ignore a value. In other words, op(x,disabledVal) should equal to x . For example, +(x,0) equals x and min(x,ma.INFINITY) equals x . So if we want to calculate the sum, we need to give 0 as disabledVal , and if we want the minimum, we need to give ma.INFINITY as disabledVal .

Using the same trick for values 4 trough 7, we can write: efficientMax(x)= ( ( max(x@0,x@1), max(x@0,x@1)@2 ) :max ), ( ( max(x@0,x@1), max(x@0,x@1)@2 ) :max@4 ) :max; We can rewrite it recursively, so it becomes possible to get the maximum at have any number of values, as long as it's a power of 2. recursiveMax = case { (1,x) => x; (N,x) => max(recursiveMax(N/2,x) , recursiveMax(N/2,x)@(N/2)); }; What if we want to look at a number of values that's not a power of 2? For each value, we will have to decide whether to use it or not. If N is bigger than the index of the value, we use it, otherwise we replace it with ( 0-(ma.INFINITY) ): variableMax(N,x) = max( max( ( (x@0 : useVal(0)), (x@1 : useVal(1)) ):max, ( (x@2 : useVal(2)), (x@3 : useVal(3)) ):max ), max( ( (x@4 : useVal(4)), (x@5 : useVal(5)) ):max, ( (x@6 : useVal(6)), (x@7 : useVal(7)) ):max ) ) with { useVal(i) = select2((N>=i) , (0-(ma.INFINITY)),_); }; Now it becomes impossible to re-use any values. To fix that let's first look at how we'd implement it using recursiveMax, but with a fixed N that is not a power of 2. For example, this is how you'd do it with N=3 : binaryMaxThree(x) = ( recursiveMax(1,x)@0, the first x recursiveMax(2,x)@1 the second and third x ):max; N=6 binaryMaxSix(x) = ( recursiveMax(2,x)@0, first two recursiveMax(4,x)@2 third trough sixth ):max; Note that recursiveMax(2,x) is used at a different delay then in binaryMaxThree , since it represents 1 and 2, not 2 and 3. Each block is delayed the combined size of the previous blocks. N=7 binaryMaxSeven(x) = ( ( recursiveMax(1,x)@0, first x recursiveMax(2,x)@1 second and third ):max, ( recursiveMax(4,x)@3 fourth trough seventh ) ):max; To make a variable version, we need to know which powers of two are used, and at which delay time. Then it becomes a matter of: lining up all the different block sizes in parallel: the first par() statement delaying each the appropriate amount: sumOfPrevBlockSizes() turning it on or off: useVal() getting the maximum of all of them: combine() In Faust, we can only do that for a fixed maximum number of values: maxN variableBinaryMaxN(N,maxN,x) = par(i,maxNrBits,recursiveMax(pow2(i),x)@sumOfPrevBlockSizes(N,maxN,i) : useVal(i)) : combine(maxNrBits) with { The sum of all the sizes of the previous blocks sumOfPrevBlockSizes(N,maxN,0) = 0; sumOfPrevBlockSizes(N,maxN,i) = (subseq((allBlockSizes(N,maxN)),0,i):>_); allBlockSizes(N,maxN) = par(i, maxNrBits, pow2(i) * isUsed(i) ); maxNrBits = int2nrOfBits(maxN); get the maximum of all blocks combine(2) = max; combine(N) = max(combine(N-1),_); Decide wether or not to use a certain value, based on N useVal(i) = select2( isUsed(i), (0-(ma.INFINITY)),_); isUsed(i) = take(i+1,(int2bin(N,maxN))); };","title":"Working Principle"},{"location":"libs/basics/#baslidingreduce","text":"Fold-like high order function.

Example See dm.pospass_demo Look at frequency response: Method A filter passing only positive frequencies can be made from a half-band lowpass by modulating it up to the positive-frequency range. Equivalently, down-modulate the input signal using a complex sinusoid at -SR/4 Hz, lowpass it with a half-band filter, and modulate back up by SR/4 Hz.

They are related to the Mth-Octave Spectrum-Analyzers in analysis.lib . The documentation of this library contains more details about the implementation. The parameters are: M : number of band-slices per octave (>1) N : total number of bands (>2) ftop : upper bandlimit of the Mth-octave bands (<SR/2) In addition to the Mth-octave output signals, there is a highpass signal containing frequencies from ftop to SR/2, and a \"dc band\" lowpass signal containing frequencies from 0 (dc) up to the start of the Mth-octave bands. Thus, the N output signals are highpass(ftop), MthOctaveBands(M,N-2,ftop), dcBand(ftop*2^(-M*(N-1))) A Filter-Bank is defined here as a signal bandsplitter having the property that summing its output signals gives an allpass-filtered version of the filter-bank input signal. A more conventional term for this is an \"allpass-complementary filter bank\". If the allpass filter is a pure delay (and possible scaling), the filter bank is said to be a \"perfect-reconstruction filter bank\" (see Vaidyanathan-1993 cited below for details). A \"graphic equalizer\", in which band signals are scaled by gains and summed, should be based on a filter bank. The filter-banks below are implemented as Butterworth or Elliptic spectrum-analyzers followed by delay equalizers that make them allpass-complementary. Increasing Channel Isolation Go to higher filter orders - see Regalia et al. or Vaidyanathan (cited below) regarding the construction of more aggressive recursive filter-banks using elliptic or Chebyshev prototype filters.

They are related to the Mth-Octave Spectrum-Analyzers in analysis.lib . The documentation of this library contains more details about the implementation. The parameters are: M : number of band-slices per octave (>1) N : total number of bands (>2) ftop : upper bandlimit of the Mth-octave bands (<SR/2) In addition to the Mth-octave output signals, there is a highpass signal containing frequencies from ftop to SR/2, and a \"dc band\" lowpass signal containing frequencies from 0 (dc) up to the start of the Mth-octave bands. Thus, the N output signals are highpass(ftop), MthOctaveBands(M,N-2,ftop), dcBand(ftop*2^(-M*(N-1))) A Filter-Bank is defined here as a signal bandsplitter having the property that summing its output signals gives an allpass-filtered version of the filter-bank input signal. A more conventional term for this is an \"allpass-complementary filter bank\". If the allpass filter is a pure delay (and possible scaling), the filter bank is said to be a \"perfect-reconstruction filter bank\" (see Vaidyanathan-1993 cited below for details). A \"graphic equalizer\", in which band signals are scaled by gains and summed, should be based on a filter bank.

Reference https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/pasp/Digital_Waveguide_Mesh.html Signal Order In and Out The mesh is constructed recursively using 2x2 embeddings. Thus, the top level of mesh_square(M) is a block 2x2 mesh, where each block is a mesh(M/2) . Let these blocks be numbered 1,2,3,4 in the geometry NW,NE,SW,SE, i.e., as 1 2 3 4 Each block has four vector inputs and four vector outputs, where the length of each vector is M/2 . Label the input vectors as Ni,Ei,Wi,Si, i.e., as the inputs from the North, East South, and West, and similarly for the outputs. Then, for example, the upper left input block of M/2 signals is labeled 1Ni. Most of the connections are internal, such as 1Eo -> 2Wi. The 8*(M/2) input signals are grouped in the order 1Ni 2Ni 3Si 4Si 1Wi 3Wi 2Ei 4Ei and the output signals are 1No 1Wo 2No 2Eo 3So 3Wo 4So 4Eo or In: 1No 1Wo 2No 2Eo 3So 3Wo 4So 4Eo Out: 1Ni 2Ni 3Si 4Si 1Wi 3Wi 2Ei 4Ei Thus, the inputs are grouped by direction N,S,W,E, while the outputs are grouped by block number 1,2,3,4, which can also be interpreted as directions NW, NE, SW, SE. A simple program illustrating these orderings is process = mesh_square(2); . Example Reflectively terminated mesh impulsed at one corner: mesh_square_test(N,x) = mesh_square(N)~(busi(4*N,x)) input to corner with { busi(N,x) = bus(N) : par(i,N,*(-1)) : par(i,N-1,_), +(x); }; process = 1-1' : mesh_square_test(4); all modes excited forever In this simple example, the mesh edges are connected as follows: 1No -> 1Ni, 1Wo -> 2Ni, 2No -> 3Si, 2Eo -> 4Si, 3So -> 1Wi, 3Wo -> 3Wi, 4So -> 2Ei, 4Eo -> 4Ei A routing matrix can be used to obtain other connection geometries.

This library provides an environment to facilitate physical modeling of musical instruments. It contains dozens of functions implementing low and high level elements going from a simple waveguide to fully operational models with built-in UI, etc. It is organized as follows: Global Variables : Useful pre-defined variables for physical modeling (e.g., speed of sound, etc.). Conversion Tools : Conversion functions specific to physical modeling (e.g., length to frequency, etc.). Bidirectional Utilities : Functions to create bidirectional block diagrams for physical modeling. Basic Elements : waveguides, specific types of filters, etc. String Instruments : various types of strings (e.g., steel, nylon, etc.), bridges, guitars, etc. Bowed String Instruments : parts and models specific to bowed string instruments (e.g., bows, bridges, violins, etc.). Wind Instrument : parts and models specific to wind string instruments (e.g., reeds, mouthpieces, flutes, clarinets, etc.). Exciters : pluck generators, \"blowers\", etc. Modal Percussions : percussion instruments based on modal models. Vocal Synthesis : functions for various vocal synthesis techniques (e.g., fof, source/filter, etc.) and vocal synthesizers. Misc Functions : any other functions that don't fit in the previous category (e.g., nonlinear filters, etc.). This library is part of the Faust Physical Modeling ToolKit. More information on how to use this library can be found on this page: * https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~rmichon/pmFaust . Tutorials on how to make physical models of musical instruments using Faust can be found here as well. Global Variables Useful pre-defined variables for physical modeling. (pm.)speedOfSound Speed of sound in meters per second (340m/s). (pm.)maxLength The default maximum length (3) in meters of strings and tubes used in this library. This variable should be overriden to allow longer strings or tubes. Conversion Tools Useful conversion tools for physical modeling. (pm.)f2l Frequency to length in meters. Usage f2l(freq) : distanceInMeters Where: freq : the frequency (pm.)l2f Length in meters to frequency. Usage l2f(length) : freq Where: length : length/distance in meters (pm.)l2s Length in meters to number of samples. Usage l2s(l) : numberOfSamples Where: l : length in meters Bidirectional Utilities Set of fundamental functions to create bi-directional block diagrams in Faust. These elements are used as the basis of this library to connect high level elements (e.g., mouthpieces, strings, bridge, instrument body, etc.). Each block has 3 inputs and 3 outputs. The first input/output carry left going waves, the second input/output carry right going waves, and the third input/output is used to carry any potential output signal to the end of the algorithm. (pm.)basicBlock Empty bidirectional block to be used with chain : 3 signals ins and 3 signals out. Usage chain(basicBlock : basicBlock : etc.) (pm.)chain Creates a chain of bidirectional blocks. Blocks must have 3 inputs and outputs. The first input/output carry left going waves, the second input/output carry right going waves, and the third input/output is used to carry any potential output signal to the end of the algorithm. The implied one sample delay created by the ~ operator is generalized to the left and right going waves. Thus, n blocks in chain() will add an n samples delay to both left and right going waves. Usage leftGoingWaves,rightGoingWaves,mixedOutput : chain( A : B ) : leftGoingWaves,rightGoingWaves,mixedOutput with{ A = _,_,_; }; (pm.)inLeftWave Adds a signal to left going waves anywhere in a chain of blocks. Usage model(x) = chain(A : inLeftWave(x) : B) Where A and B are bidirectional blocks and x is the signal added to left going waves in that chain. (pm.)inRightWave Adds a signal to right going waves anywhere in a chain of blocks. Usage model(x) = chain(A : inRightWave(x) : B) Where A and B are bidirectional blocks and x is the signal added to right going waves in that chain. (pm.)in Adds a signal to left and right going waves anywhere in a chain of blocks. Usage model(x) = chain(A : in(x) : B) Where A and B are bidirectional blocks and x is the signal added to left and right going waves in that chain. (pm.)outLeftWave Sends the signal of left going waves to the output channel of the chain . Usage chain(A : outLeftWave : B) Where A and B are bidirectional blocks. (pm.)outRightWave Sends the signal of right going waves to the output channel of the chain . Usage chain(A : outRightWave : B) Where A and B are bidirectional blocks. (pm.)out Sends the signal of right and left going waves to the output channel of the chain . Usage chain(A : out : B) Where A and B are bidirectional blocks. (pm.)terminations Creates terminations on both sides of a chain without closing the inputs and outputs of the bidirectional signals chain. As for chain , this function adds a 1 sample delay to the bidirectional signal, both ways. Of courses, this function can be nested within a chain . Usage terminations(a,b,c) with{ }; (pm.)lTermination Creates a termination on the left side of a chain without closing the inputs and outputs of the bidirectional signals chain.

It is based on the block diagram in Figure 7.5. The Oberheim filter is a state-variable filter with soft-clipping distortion within the circuit. In many VA filters, distortion is accomplished using the \"tanh\" function. For this Faust implementation, that distortion function was replaced with the (ef.)cubicnl function.

The modeling approach is based on a Topology Preserving Transform (TPT) to resolve the delay-free feedback loop in the corresponding analog filters. The primary processing block used to build other filters (Moog, Korg, etc.) is based on a 1st-order Sallen-Key filter. The filters included in this script are 1st-order LPF/HPF and 2nd-order state-variable filters capable of LPF, HPF, and BPF. Resources: Vadim Zavalishin (2018) \"The Art of VA Filter Design\", v2.1.0 https://www.nativeinstruments.com/fileadmin/ni_media/downloads/pdf/VAFilterDesign_2.1.0.pdf Will Pirkle (2014) \"Resolving Delay-Free Loops in Recursive Filters Using the Modified H\u00e4rm\u00e4 Method\", AES 137 http://www.aes.org/elib/browse.cfm?elib=17517 Description and diagrams of 1st- and 2nd-order TPT filters: https://www.willpirkle.com/7062/ (ve.)sallenKeyOnePole Sallen-Key generic One Pole filter (see description above). For the Faust implementation of this filter, recursion ( letrec ) is used for storing filter \"states\". The output (e.g. y ) is calculated by using the input signal and the previous states of the filter. During the current recursive step, the states of the filter (e.g. s ) for the next step are also calculated. Admittedly, this is not an efficient way to implement a filter because it requires independently calculating the output and each state during each recursive step. However, it works as a way to store and use \"states\" within the constraints of Faust. The simplest example is the 1st-order LPF (shown on the cover of Zavalishin * 2018 and Fig 4.3 of https://www.willpirkle.com/7062/ ). Here, the input signal is split in parallel for the calculation of the output signal, y , and the state, s. The value of the state is only used for feedback to the next step of recursion. It is blocked (!) from also being routed to the output. A trick used for calculating the state, s, is to observe that the input to the delay block is the sum of two signal: what appears to be a feedforward path and a feedback path. In reality, the signals being summed are identical (signal*2) plus the value of the current state.

See Figure 4.6 of * https://www.willpirkle.com/7062/ This is also a good example of the next step for generalizing the Faust programming approach used for all these VA filters. In this case, there are three things to calculate each recursive step (y,s1,s2). For each thing, the circuit is only calculated up to that point. Comparing the LPF to BPF, the output signal (y) is calculated similarly. Except, the output of the BPF stops earlier in the circuit. Similarly, the states (s1 and s2) only differ in that s2 includes a couple more terms beyond what is used for s1.
