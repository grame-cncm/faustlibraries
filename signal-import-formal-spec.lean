  Lean 4 specification for:

    faustlibraries-code-doc-audit-2026-08-15-en.md, §10.3 architecture B

  Scope
  -----
  Imports a compiled Faust signal graph into Lean and certifies, mechanically,
  that its feedback recursion is stable.

  This file is the hand-written, reviewed prelude. The terms it is applied to
  are generated from `faust-rs --dump-sig` by `scripts/sig2lean.py`:

      export FAUST_RS=<faust-rs>/target/release/faust-rs
      export FAUST_LIBS=<faustlibraries>
      scripts/sig2lean.py signal-import-formal-spec.lean out.lean f.dsp ...
      lean out.lean                                # Lean 4.31, bundled Std

  The generator runs Lean once to read each verdict, then emits a
  `by decide` theorem pinning it. The theorem is the artefact: Lean proves it,
  the generator only predicts it.

  Nothing in this prelude depends on the generated part, so it can be reviewed
  on its own.

  This file uses only Lean's bundled Std library. It contains no `sorry` and no
  axioms beyond `propext`. Validate it with:

/-! ## Exact coefficients

Every IEEE-754 double is exactly `m / 2ᵏ`, so coefficients are carried as an
integer pair rather than as `Rat`: in Std 4.31 `Rat` does not kernel-reduce, so
`decide` (and `grind`, and `rfl`) get stuck on `Rat.instDecidableLt`. Integer
pairs keep every check decidable. -/

/-! ## The imported graph

`Sig` mirrors the tags emitted by `--dump-sig`. It is deliberately **total**:
every tag the importer does not model becomes `opaqueN`, which no analysis
below can ever read as a linear term. Adding a tag can therefore only make the
certifier accept more, never make it accept something wrong. -/

/-! ## The Jury criterion

For a denominator `1 + a₁z⁻¹ + a₂z⁻²` the order-2 criterion is `|a₂| < 1`
together with `|a₁| < 1 + a₂`; at order 1 it is `|a₁| < 1`. Both are cleared
of denominators here so every comparison is over `Int`. -/

/-! ## Index bounds

A second, independent analysis over the same imported graph: are table reads
and delay taps addressed within range?

The safety of a Faust table read is **not** in general visible in the signal
graph. `rdtable` emits a bare index, and the bound is inserted later by the
backend from the compiler's interval analysis of that index — for a slider,
from its declared range, which `--dump-sig` does not carry. What the graph
*does* show is when an index is bounded by its own structure: a literal, an
explicit `min`/`max` clamp written in the library source (as `delays.lib`
does), or a remainder.

So the analysis below is a **classifier**, not a bug finder: it separates the
sites whose safety follows from the graph alone from those that delegate it to
metadata outside the graph. Only the first kind can be certified here; the
second is reported as unproven, never as unsafe. -/

/-- A conservative integer range with **independently** optional sides:
    `max 0 x` bounds the low side while leaving the high side unknown, which a
    single `Option (Int × Int)` cannot express. `none` on a side always means
    "no bound follows from the term", and is always a safe answer. -/
structure Range where
  lo : Option Int
  hi : Option Int
deriving Repr, DecidableEq

namespace Range
def unknown : Range := ⟨none, none⟩
def exact (k : Int) : Range := ⟨some k, some k⟩

/-- Best bound available from one or both sides. -/
private def meet (f : Int → Int → Int) : Option Int → Option Int → Option Int
  | some x, some y => some (f x y)
  | some x, none   => some x
  | none,   some y => some y
  | none,   none   => none

private def join (f : Int → Int → Int) : Option Int → Option Int → Option Int
  | some x, some y => some (f x y)
  | _,      _      => none

/-- `min x y ≤ x`, so one known upper bound suffices; the lower bound needs both. -/
def rmin (a b : Range) : Range := ⟨join min a.lo b.lo, meet min a.hi b.hi⟩

/-- Dually for `max`. -/
def rmax (a b : Range) : Range := ⟨meet max a.lo b.lo, join max a.hi b.hi⟩
end Range

/-- Range of a subterm, when one follows from its structure alone.

    Recursion is on an explicit fuel counter rather than on `Sig`: the
    interesting cases descend into the *children of an `opaqueN` list*, which
    Lean does not accept as structurally decreasing on a nested inductive, and
    a `partial def` would be opaque to the kernel — `#eval` would work but
    `decide` would not. Running out of fuel yields the unknown range. -/

/-! ## Standing obligations

Two gaps are recorded here rather than silently relied upon.

1. **Adequacy of the import.** `Sig` is asserted to mirror what
   `--dump-sig` emits. Nothing in Lean checks that; it is a review gate, and
   the honest mitigation is round-tripping the generated terms back to the
   dump text and diffing.

2. **Adequacy of `feedbackOf`.** It is asserted to return the feedback
   coefficients of the recursion it was given. Proving that needs a denotation
   `Sig → (ℕ → ℝ)` and hence mathlib. Until then the guarantee is one-sided
   but useful: `feedbackOf` returns `none` on anything it does not recognise
   exactly, so a `true` verdict is never produced from a graph it misread —
   only from one it read as a plain second-order linear recursion.

The classical equivalence "Jury criterion ⟺ roots inside the unit disc" is the
same standing obligation as in `tf2s-stability-formal-spec.lean`.

Note also that certification is over the **exact rationals** denoted by the
exported double-precision coefficients. It says nothing about the behaviour of
the filter as executed in floating point. -/
