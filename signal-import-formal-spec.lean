  Lean 4 specification for:

    faustlibraries-code-doc-audit-2026-08-15-en.md, §10.3 architecture B

  Scope
  -----
  Imports a compiled Faust signal graph into Lean and certifies, mechanically,
  that its feedback recursion is stable.

  This file is the hand-written, reviewed prelude. The terms it is applied to
  are generated from `faust-rs --dump-sig` by `scripts/sig2lean.py`:

      export FAUST_RS=<faust-rs>/target/release/faust-rs
      export FAUST_LIBS=<faustlibraries>
      scripts/sig2lean.py signal-import-formal-spec.lean out.lean f.dsp ...
      lean out.lean                                # Lean 4.31, bundled Std

  The generator runs Lean once to read each verdict, then emits a
  `by decide` theorem pinning it. The theorem is the artefact: Lean proves it,
  the generator only predicts it.

  Nothing in this prelude depends on the generated part, so it can be reviewed
  on its own.

  This file uses only Lean's bundled Std library. It contains no `sorry` and no
  axioms beyond `propext`. Validate it with:

namespace Faust.Signal

/-! ## Exact coefficients

Every IEEE-754 double is exactly `m / 2ᵏ`, so coefficients are carried as an
integer pair rather than as `Rat`: in Std 4.31 `Rat` does not kernel-reduce, so
`decide` (and `grind`, and `rfl`) get stuck on `Rat.instDecidableLt`. Integer
pairs keep every check decidable. -/

/-! ## The imported graph

`Sig` mirrors the tags emitted by `--dump-sig`. It is deliberately **total**:
every tag the importer does not model becomes `opaqueN`, which no analysis
below can ever read as a linear term. Adding a tag can therefore only make the
certifier accept more, never make it accept something wrong. -/

inductive Sig where
  | const   (q : Q)
  | int     (i : Int)
  | input   (i : Int)
  | delay1  (x : Sig)
  | delay   (x n : Sig)
  | proj    (i : Int) (x : Sig)

/-! A real filter does not have its recursion at the root: `fi.tf2` emits the
numerator applied to the recursive state, so the `SIGREC` sits *below* a sum of
taps. The recursion is therefore searched for, not assumed. -/

mutual

/-- Feedback coefficients of a second-order (or lower) linear recursion,
    written `y[n] = c₁·y[n-1] + c₂·y[n-2] + (terms free of y)`.

    Returns `none` — refusing to certify — whenever the term does not hold
    exactly one single-output recursion, or when any addend of that recursion
    mentions it without being exactly such a tap: a nonlinear recursion, a
    delay-free loop (`k = 0`), an order above 2, or an unmodelled node. -/
def analyseRec : Sig → Option (Q × Q)
  | .proj 0 (.recur (.cons body .nil)) => scanBody (addends true body) Q.zero Q.zero

/-- `Sig` is a nested inductive, so `deriving DecidableEq` does not apply and
    the collected recursions cannot be deduplicated structurally. Comparing
    their *analyses* instead is both cheaper and sufficient: the verdict is
    accepted only when every recursion in the graph yields the same feedback
    pair, in which case certifying that pair certifies all of them. -/

/-! ## The Jury criterion

For a denominator `1 + a₁z⁻¹ + a₂z⁻²` the order-2 criterion is `|a₂| < 1`
together with `|a₁| < 1 + a₂`; at order 1 it is `|a₁| < 1`. Both are cleared
of denominators here so every comparison is over `Int`. -/

/-- `a₁`, `a₂` from the feedback coefficients: the denominator of
    `y[n] = c₁y[n-1] + c₂y[n-2] + …` is `1 - c₁z⁻¹ - c₂z⁻²`. -/
def denomCoefs (c : Q × Q) : Q × Q := (c.1.neg, c.2.neg)

def juryStableB (a : Q × Q) : Bool :=
  let n1 := a.1.n * a.2.d
  let n2 := a.2.n * a.1.d
  let D  := a.1.d * a.2.d
  decide (0 < D) &&
  decide (n2.natAbs < D.natAbs) &&
  decide (0 < D + n2 - n1) &&
  decide (0 < D + n2 + n1)

/-- The end-to-end certifier: import graph in, verdict out. -/
def certifyStableB (s : Sig) : Bool :=
  match feedbackOf s with
  | some c => juryStableB (denomCoefs c)
  | none   => false

/-- Human-readable form of the same computation, for `#eval`. -/
def certifyReport (s : Sig) : String :=
  match feedbackOf s with
  | none => "not a recognised linear recursion of order <= 2 — not certified"
  | some c =>
      let a := denomCoefs c
      s!"a1 = {a.1.n}/{a.1.d}, a2 = {a.2.n}/{a.2.d} => " ++
      (if juryStableB a then "STABLE" else "NOT STABLE")

/-! ## Standing obligations

Two gaps are recorded here rather than silently relied upon.

1. **Adequacy of the import.** `Sig` is asserted to mirror what
   `--dump-sig` emits. Nothing in Lean checks that; it is a review gate, and
   the honest mitigation is round-tripping the generated terms back to the
   dump text and diffing.

2. **Adequacy of `feedbackOf`.** It is asserted to return the feedback
   coefficients of the recursion it was given. Proving that needs a denotation
   `Sig → (ℕ → ℝ)` and hence mathlib. Until then the guarantee is one-sided
   but useful: `feedbackOf` returns `none` on anything it does not recognise
   exactly, so a `true` verdict is never produced from a graph it misread —
   only from one it read as a plain second-order linear recursion.

The classical equivalence "Jury criterion ⟺ roots inside the unit disc" is the
same standing obligation as in `tf2s-stability-formal-spec.lean`.

Note also that certification is over the **exact rationals** denoted by the
exported double-precision coefficients. It says nothing about the behaviour of
the filter as executed in floating point. -/
