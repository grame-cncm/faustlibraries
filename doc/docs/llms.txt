# Faust Libraries
> Faust Libraries is the standard DSP library collection for the Faust language. This file points to the most useful documentation for LLM-assisted use.

These docs are authored in Markdown in the repository and built into HTML for the website. When possible, prefer the Markdown sources for clean, LLM-friendly content.
