# Libraries from the community

A lot of libraries have been developed by the community. They are presented in the following sections. 

## [abclib library](https://github.com/alainbonardi/abclib/)
### 20 years of research, teaching and creation in mixed music using Faust language
abclib library is released by the CICM / MUSIDANSE (Centre de Recherches Informatique et Cr√©ation Musicale, Paris 8 University) and is the result of 20 years of research, teaching and creation in mixed music, expressed as a set of codes in Faust language. The main topics addressed are: spatial sound processing and synthesis using ambisonics, multi-channel sound processing, utility objects for mixed music.

## [Edge of Chaos](https://github.com/dariosanfilippo/edgeofchaos)

This repository contains libraries including some essential building blocks for the implementation of musical complex adaptive systems in Faust programming.

It includes a set of time-domain algorithms, some of which are original, for the processing of low-level and high-level information as well as the processing of sound using standard and non-conventional techniques. It also includes functions for the realisation of networks with different topologies, linear and nonlinear mapping strategies to render positive and negative feedback relationships, and different kinds of energy-preserving techniques for the stability of self-oscillating systems.


## [realfaust](https://github.com/dariosanfilippo/realfaust)

This library contains a set of functions representing domain-limited versions of all Faust primitives and math functions that can potentially generate INF or NaN values. The goal of the library is to be able to implement DSP networks that, structurally, are free from INF and NaN values. Hence, the resulting programs should be rock-solid during real-time performance and virtually immune to crashes regardless of how mercilessly a network is modulated or how unstable a recursive system is made.


## [bitDSP-faust](https://github.com/rottingsounds/bitDSP-faust)
BitDSP is a set of Faust library functions aimed to help explore and research artistic possibilities of bit-based algorithms. BitDSP currently includes implementations of bit-based functions ranging from simple bit operations over classic delta-sigma modulations to more experimental approaches like cellular automata, recursive Boolean networks, and linear feedback shift registers.

A detailed overview of the functionality is in the [paper](https://ifc20.sciencesconf.org/332745/document) "Creative use of bit-stream DSP in Faust" presented at [IFC 2020](https://ifc20.sciencesconf.org/).


## [SEAM library](https://github.com/s-e-a-m/faust-libraries)

Sustained Electro-Acoustic Music is a project inspired by [Alvise Vidolin and Nicola Bernardini](https://www.academia.edu/16348988/Sustainable_live_electro-acoustic_music). The SEAM libraries have been developed for this project.
