# Contributing

In general, libraries are organised in a *stacked manner*: the base ones define functions or constants without any dependancies, and additional ones are gradually built on top of simpler ones, layer by layer. **Dependency loops must be avoided as much as possible**. The *resources* folder contains tools to build and visualise the libraries dependencies graphs.

If you wish to add a function to any of these libraries or if you plan to add a new library, make sure that you observe the following conventions:

## New Functions

* All functions must be preceded by a markdown documentation header respecting the following format (open the source code of any of the libraries for an example):

```
//-----------------functionName--------------------
// Description
//
// #### Usage
//
// ```
// Usage Example
// ```
//
// Where:
//
// * argument1: argument 1 description
//-------------------------------------------------
```

* Every time a new function is added, the documentation should be updated simply by running `make doclib`. <!-- TODO -->
* The environment system (e.g. `os.osc`) should be used when calling a function declared in another library (see the section on [Library Import](#library-import)).
* Try to reuse existing functions as much as possible.
* The `Usage` line must show the *input/output shape* (the number of inputs and outputs) of the function, like `gen: _` for a mono generator, `_ : filter : _` for a mono effect, etc.
* Some functions use parameters that are [constant numerical expressions](https://faustdoc.grame.fr/manual/syntax/#constant-numerical-expressions). The convention is to label them in *capital letters* and document them preferably to be *constant numerical expressions* (or *known at compile time* in existing libraries).
* If you have any question, send an e-mail to rmichon_at_ccrma_dot_stanford_dot_edu.

## New Libraries

* Any new "standard" library should be declared in `stdfaust.lib` with its own environment (2 letters - see `stdfaust.lib`).
* Any new "standard" library must be added to `generateDoc`.
* Functions must be organized by sections.
* Any new library should at least `declare` a `name` and a `version`.
* Any new library has to use a prefix declared in the header section with the following kind of syntax: `Its official prefix is 'qu'` (look at an existing library to follow the exact syntax).
* The comment based markdown documentation of each library must respect the following format (open the source code of any of the libraries for an example):

```
//############### libraryName ##################
// Description
//
// * Section Name 1
// * Section Name 2
// * ...
//
// It should be used using the `[...]` environment:
//
// ```
// [...] = library("libraryName");
// process = [...].functionCall;
// ```
//
// Another option is to import `stdfaust.lib` which already contains the `[...]`
// environment:
//
// ```
// import("stdfaust.lib");
// process = [...].functionCall;
// ```
//##############################################

//================= Section Name ===============
// Description
//==============================================
```
* If you have any question, send an e-mail to rmichon_at_ccrma_dot_stanford_dot_edu.

## Coding Conventions

In order to have a uniformized library system, we established the following conventions (that hopefully will be followed by others when making modifications to them).

### Documentation

* All the functions that we want to be "public" are documented.
* We used the `faust2md` "standards" for each library: `//###` for main title (library name - equivalent to `#` in markdown), `//===` for section declarations (equivalent to `##` in markdown) and `//---` for function declarations (equivalent to `####` in markdown - see `basics.lib` for an example).
* Sections in function documentation should be declared as `####` markdown title.
* Each function documentation provides a "Usage" section (see `basics.lib`). 
* The full documentation can be generated using the doc/Makefile script. Use `make help` to see all possible commands. If you plan to create a pull-request, *do not commit the full generated code* but only the modified .lib files.

### Library Import

To prevent cross-references between libraries, we generalized the use of the `library("")` system for function calls in all the libraries. This means that everytime a function declared in another library is called, the environment corresponding to this library needs to be called too. To make things easier, a `stdfaust.lib` library was created and is imported by all the libraries:

```
aa = library("aanl.lib");
sf = library("all.lib");
an = library("analyzers.lib");
ba = library("basics.lib");
co = library("compressors.lib");
de = library("delays.lib");
dm = library("demos.lib");
dx = library("dx7.lib");
en = library("envelopes.lib");
fd = library("fds.lib");
fi = library("filters.lib");
ho = library("hoa.lib");
it = library("interpolators.lib");
ma = library("maths.lib");
mi = library("mi.lib");
ef = library("misceffects.lib");
os = library("oscillators.lib");
no = library("noises.lib");
pf = library("phaflangers.lib");
pm = library("physmodels.lib");
qu = library("quantizers.lib");
rm = library("reducemaps.lib");
re = library("reverbs.lib");
ro = library("routes.lib");
si = library("signals.lib");
so = library("soundfiles.lib");
sp = library("spats.lib");
sy = library("synths.lib");
ve = library("vaeffects.lib");
vl = library("version.lib");
wa = library("webaudio.lib");
wd = library("wdmodels.lib");
```

For example, if we wanted to use the `smooth` function which is now declared in `signals.lib`, we would do the following:

```
import("stdfaust.lib");

process = si.smooth(0.999);
```

This standard is only used within the libraries: nothing prevents coders to still import `signals.lib` directly and call `smooth` without `ro.`, etc. It means symbols and function names defined within a library **have to be unique to not collide with symbols of any other libraries**.  

### "Demo" Functions

"Demo" functions are placed in `demos.lib` and have a built-in user interface (UI). Their name ends with the `_demo` suffix. Each of these function have a `.dsp` file associated to them in the `/examples` folder.

Any function containing UI elements should be placed in this library and respect these standards.

### "Standard" Functions

"Standard" functions are here to simplify the life of new (or not so new) Faust coders. They are declared in `/libraries/doc/standardFunctions.md` and allow to point programmers to preferred functions to carry out a specific task. For example, there are many different types of lowpass filters declared in `filters.lib` and only one of them is considered to be standard, etc.

## Testing the library

Before preparing a pull-request, the new library must be carefully tested:

- all functions defined  in the  library must be tested by preparing a DSP test program
- the  compatibilty library `all.lib` imports all libraries in a same namespace, so check functions names collisions using the following test program:

```
import("all.lib");
process = _;
```
